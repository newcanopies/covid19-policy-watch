            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "As part of the \u20ac4 billion fund to mitigate the effects of the Corona crisis, which the Austrian national government and the social partners presented on 14 March 2020, they also presented two hardship funds: one for self-employed in one person companies; and the other for family-run businesses. This was complementary to other measures (see case AT-2020-12-/229), as those two target groups would not be able to profit from the short-time working schemes.\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The support is a one-off payment and does not have to be paid back. In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:\r\rPhase 1: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is \u20ac500 if the net income p.a. was below \u20ac6,000 and \u20ac1,000 if it was above \u20ac6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is \u20ac33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accomodation rents) and freelance workers.\r\rPhase 2: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at \u20ac2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.\rAll applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to \u20ac6,000. \rIn general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 December 2020. ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Info from 1 April: Around 100,000 applications for phase 1 were counted so far. The total funds for the hardship fund were increased from \u20ac1 to 2 billion.\rInfo from 20 April: The first phase has been completed with 144,000 applications made.

The grant will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions but does not need to be repaid.

The objective is to ease the financing of business credits for companies, whose revenues and profits have been affected due to the stop of orders, deliveries or other changes of the economic environment, as a consequence of the Corona crisis.

See related case 'State support for tourism' (AT-2020-10/215). The guarantee supports 80% of a short term 'bridging' loan, the duration of which cannot exceed 5 years.\r\rThe company can request this support via their own bank, a decision will be taken by the public support company AWS (Austrian economic service).\r\rAs of 7 April 2020, the AWS bridging guarantee was significantly expanded with immediate effect as part of the government's \u20ac15 billion aid fund.  The immediately implemented innovations include a 100% guarantee rate for loans up to \u20ac500,000 and a 90% guarantee rate for loan amounts up to \u20ac27.7 million.",

The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees\u2019 (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (\u00a32,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.\r\rEmployers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.\r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The scheme has been critizised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and runnning by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.",

This individual agreement contains, in general, significant dispositions steering the performance under the smart working regime, like the rules implementing the right to disconnect. Moreover, Article 1, lett. n) specifies that the informative obligations bearing on the employer according to Law No. 81 of 2017 can be fulfilled, while the measure is into force, through electronic communications. \r\rThe measure concerns all the employers, regardless their dimension or sector, and is meant to remain in power until 31 July 2020 (day in which the six-month state of emergency declared by the Government on 31 January 2020 will expire). \r\rFurthermore, this measure affects only employees, since smart working is not applicable to other categories of workers (for instance freelancers, self-employed etc.).\rSocial partners, finally, have not been involved in the preparatory works of this measure.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Short-time work enables working hours to be reduced within a company during temporary economic difficulties. Short-time work has been a well established crisis measure for a long time and was last used to a great extent during the 2008/09 financial crisis, alleviating the economic downturn to quite some extent. (see e.g. a Eurofound report from 2010: https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2010/austria/working-conditions-labour-market-business/austria-short-time-working-subsidy).",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Short time work scheme applies if a company temporarily reduces the working time. In order to prevent dismissals and to protect businesses and employees from negative economic and social impacts of COVID-19, social partners (Chamber of Labour, Trade Unions, Economic Chamber) negotiated the current scheme. \r\rWorking hours of employees can be reduced up to zero hours keeping full / almost full pay. The employer only pays for the actual working time. \r\rReduced working hours: The reduced standard working hours must be on average between 10% and 90% of standard working hours as agreed under collective working arrangements. A new aspect of this is that it may temporarily also be set at zero. Thus, for instance, in the context of a short-time working period of six weeks, it may be set at 0% for five weeks (i.e. no work will take place, and for one week at 60%). Another important point to note is that, in some business sectors, the agreement on short-time work may also include overtime.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 14 April 2020, short-time work applications have been made for the jobs of 608,607 people. Therefore, the funds for short-time work support are increased for the second time, from three to five billion euros (Source: Der Standard, 14 April, 2020).",

Business activity of the SME has to be included at the supported economic activities list, which is, however, very wide and included accommodation, logistics, manufacturing industry etc. \r\r\u010cMZRB will secure the commercial loan up to 80% with the maximum period of 3 years. SME can also apply for financial support on the loan interest up to CZK 1,000,000 (\u20ac36,298 approx.). Loan to be secured are limited to CZK 15,000,000 (\u20ac544,465). The loans are intended to cover salaries, rent, utility costs and suplier-customer invoices. \r\rThe total amount for COVID II programme is CZK 4,000,000,000 (\u20ac145,190,563).\r\rThe program is financed from the EU Structural Funds within the OPPIK and is therefore not intended for the implementation of projects in the capital city of Prague. Financial support for projects implemented in Prague can be applied for in the COVID Prague guarantee program.\r\r\r\r",

In normal circumstances, the notice period for temporary lay-offs is 14 days. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Act was amended in March 2020 and therefore the notice period will be 5 days  between April and June 2020. \r\rMany collective agreements further regulate the notice period for temporary lay-offs and these regulations laid down in collective agreements shall apply.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "To minimize personal contacts, the government temporarily closed the most of retail and facilities providing services, except of those selling foodstuff, food for pets and health-care aids, veterinary corps, pharmacies, drugstores, posts, banks and insurance agencies, telecom operators, catering establishments, gasoline stations and tobacco and printed media shops. \rRestaurants, fast-foods and canteens can provide only take-away food, usually lunch menu. These measures had, hence, a wide impact on some employers, that were totally or partially prevented from work. \rAs a partial relief, in order to diminish temporarily the labour-related expenditures (compulsory payments to the social insurance) of those employers, the government adopted the measure by Section 293ew of the amended Act on social insurance.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measures entailed the introduction of some amendments to the Social insurance act, postponing the deadline for compulsory payments of employers and self-employed to social security funds. \rAccording to this framework, any employer and self-employed paying compulsory contributions to health and pension insurance funds, and whose revenue from business decreased by at least 40%, are entitled to pay these contributions within 31 July 2020, rather than in March 2020. If needed, the government can prolong the adopted deadline. The Government Order (Nariadenie vlady 76/2020) allows more options for the determination of the revenue decrease: comparison with March 2019, February 2020 and 2019 monthly average.",

According to the amendments to the Law, the amount of the subsidy may reach 90% or 70% of the wage amount subject to the employer's choice. If the employer contributes 10% and chooses a 90% subsidy, the state will contribute max. one minimum monthly wage (MMW) (\u20ac607 gross); if the employer chooses a 70% subsidy, the state will be able to contribute more - 1.5 MMW or \u20ac910.5 gross. Wages accrued during idle time may not exceed those fixed earlier in the employment contract. Payment of the subsidy shall be terminated when the government revokes the emergency or quarantine. Employers shall have to inform the State Labour Inspectorate on the establishment of idle time for employees. Having used the subsidy, the employer is required to retain at least 50% of jobs for at least three months from the end of the payment of the subsidy. ",

The measures can be divided into two main groups. The first set of measures are measures that are horizontal in nature and are aimed at maintaining the stability of the economy through the provision of stand-style arrangements and new liquidity. The second set of measures refers to sectoral measures that are both vertically and horizontally targeted with the aim of encouraging everyone to actively undertake activities aimed at preserving jobs, i.e. safeguarding employment. In this regard, 16 laws have been amended. Additional amendments to the General tax law have been adopted  on 7 April (OG 42/2020) ( see case number 288) and the new Ordinance on Amendments to the Ordinance on Implementation of the General Tax Law published on 8 April. (OG 43/2020).",

For companies that have revenue of more than HRK 7.5 million (\u20ac 1 million) and have a revenue drop of more than 50 -100%, taxes and social contributions will be proportionally written off over the next three months. \r\rTherefore, if a company has a revenue drop of 75%, it will pay 25% of taxes and contributions over the next three months. The companies that generate more than HRK 7.5 million (\u20ac 1 million), the 7% of big companies, will be exempt from their tax liabilities in proportion to the decrease in their revenue in April, May, and July. If their revenue has decreased by 20% to 50%, they are entitled to a deferral and interest-free payment in installments, those whose revenue has decreased by 50% to 100% will pay proportionately, and if their revenue has decreased by 75%, they will only pay 25% of their tax liabilities.

The measure was added to the Employment Programme 2017-2020 (programme through which additional active labour market measures are provided by the Unemployment Insurance Fund). It was discussed and approved by the Council of the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund and put into effect by a Government decree. The applications are accepted as of April 6 2020.",

It must be applied for by the employer, but is paid directly to the employee.\r\rThe amount of the subsidy is 70% of the average monthly wage of the employee. The maximum amount of the subsidy is \u20ac1,000. The employment and social security taxes are also paid by the EUIF. The employer must pay additionally a wage of at least \u20ac150 to the employee (plus pay national taxes on the wage).\r\rThe subsidy is paid for up to two months for March, April or May 2020.",

According to the explanatory note of the regulation, in February 2020, there were altogether 555,261 employees in Estonia who were paid on the basis of an employment contract.

On 17 March 2020, the Law No. XIII-2812 amending Article 88 of Law No. IX-2112 on Tax Administration of the Republic of Lithuania was adopted to increase the ability of taxpayers with temporary financial difficulties to stabilize their financial situation through deferral or arrangement of tax payment arrears.",

These taxpayers are subject to analogous measures to facilitate the payment of state social insurance contributions. This principle shall apply to taxes that are due after 16 March 2020 (i.e. after the declaration of quarantine) until the state of emergency is lifted.",

For business that were not active in the previous year, the basis of comparison will be the months proceeding March 2020. The Scheme is in accordance with Decree 131 of the Quarantine Law, Chapter 260 of the Ministry of Health.  \r\r* On Wednesday 8 April, the President of the Republic announced the decision of the Cabinet to extent the measure up until 12 June 2020. Currently, the Ministry of Labour undertakes a legal and technical processing of the measure. ",

Business participating, in addition, should not dismiss any employee during the participating period, during an additional month equal to the period of participation and plus one additional month. \r\rBusinesses up to 50 employees may join the Scheme by declaring the 75% of their total number of employees to receive the special unemployment benefit. Similarly, businesses employing more than 50 employees may declare  60% of their total number of employees. \r\rThe maximum amount for a period of a month may not exceed 1,214 euros. \r\rOn the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible. The insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison.  \r\rAdditionally, a minimum payable amount of 356 euros has been defined for beneficiaries. Also, a special plan will be implemented for employees who first started work in February and March 2020.\r \rAn additional amendment to the Scheme is the inclusion of persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work. \r  \r \r\r\r ",

The businesses, therefore, can use their savings for other important purposes. The measure is implemented in accordance with Description 1 of the conditions for financing projects under measure J03-IVG-T under priority axis 3 \u201cPromoting the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises\u201d and priority axis 4 \u201cPromoting energy efficiency and the production and use of renewable energy\u201d under the Operational Programme for EU Structural Funds Investments for 2014-2020, as supplemented on 3 April 2020 by the Order No. 4-201 of the Minister for the Economy and Innovation.",

If the financial institution defers the payment of loans or financial leasing, the borrowers will be reimbursed 100% of interest payable during the period of deferral. In addition, interest compensations will be paid on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis. The interests will be reimbursed in respect of investment and working capital loans, as well as financial leasing agreements, provided that the company meets certain criteria (e.g., interest compensation during the deferral period is not available for companies engaged in road freight transport wishing to purchase vehicles for freight transportation; for farmers; in respect of overdrafts, credit lines, factoring, operating lease contracts, etc.). The interest rate from which the maximum amount of partial reimbursement of interest is calculated shall not exceed 7%. The reimbursement of interest shall be applied within the de minimis aid ceiling (\u20ac200,000) for a period exceeding six months \u2013 until 31 December 2020.",

The maximum amount that would be paid as a special sick leave may not exceed 1,214 euros.  \r\rOn the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible currently out of work or full-time work. For the purpose of paying the Special Sick Leave Benefit, the insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison taking into account the 60% for both calculations.  \r\rAdditionally, a minimum payable amount of 356 euros has been defined for beneficiaries, which amount is equal to the lowest statutory pension. \r\rAn additional amendment to the Scheme is the inclusion of persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month. \r\rHowever, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.  ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3.250,00 (\u20ac434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1.625,00 (\u20ac217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250.00 or HRK 1,625.00 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate. \r\rThe support can be provided to \ra) employers in the following activities: providing accommodation and preparation and serving of food and drinks (Sector I), transportation and storage (Sector H) and health tourism; labour-intensive activities within the manufacturing industry like textiles, clothing, footwear, leather, wood and furniture; \rb) employers who have been banned from performing their business activities by decisions of the Civil Protection Headquarters (national, county, local self-government units) and cannot carry out their activities, and \rc) all other employers who can prove the adverse impact of special circumstances, if their income is reduced by more than 20%. \r\rSince 26 March 2020 all beneficiaries of grants for self-employment (owners and employees), employers who have been registered at the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute by 29 February 2020 and all workers employed until 29 February 2020 have also been included. \r\rThe support cannot be granted if there has been a decrease in the number of employees in the period from 20 March 2020 until the date of submission of the Grant Application, if the percentage of dismissal is greater than: \r40 % for employers employing up to 10 workers; \r20 % for small businesses; 1\r5 % for medium-sized enterprises and \r10 % for large companies. \r\rThe aforementioned amount of the grant - HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker - is applied for March 2020, while for April and May 2020 it will be increased per worker monthly to HRK 4,000 (\u20ac 534) for full-time job or HRK 2,625 (\u20ac 267) for part-time job. The state will also cover also payment of social contributions, which amounts to HRK 1,460 (\u20ac 194) for a net wage of HRK 4,000. In total, the state will pay HRK 5,460 (\u20ac 728) per employee. \r\r ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "At the end of March,  around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES.  At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (EURO 200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.\rThe main criterion for assistance was a 20 percent drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (EURO 1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.

When the supplementary state budget is approved, the EHIF will compensate those days to all employees irrespective of the reason of the sick leave (i.e. in addition to corona virus, the person can have other disease or injury in order to receive compensation). As usual, the days 4-8 will be compensated by the employer, and then continued by the EHIF. The measure will be valid retroactively as of 13 March (the beginning of the emergency situation) until the end of the emergency situation currently set to 1 May). Those, who have used sick leave and whose first three days were not compensated, receive the compensation retroactively.\r\rDue to an emergency situation an additional measure was introduced, which allows worker temporarily to apply on-line for a sick leave by his- or herself.

The debt moratorium does not apply to credit cards, overdrafts, revolving loans, operating leases or loans related to capital market transactions. Repayments cannot be deferred for loans where the debtor has been late in repayment for over 30 days as of 26 March 2020.

Furthermore, grants obtained do not affects the threshold of realized annual revenues according to which the tax rate of 12% and 18% is determined (the threshold is HRK 7.5 million (\u20ac 1 million) of revenue. \rIt is hard to predict the role of this measure and the number of possible users but from the public discussions it can be assessed that it would be relatively limited.

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "From 13 March 2020, the notion of temporary unemployment due to force majeure will be flexibly applied by the NEO. All situations of temporary unemployment due to the corona virus can be considered as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even if, for example, it is still possible to work on certain days.\r\rFor the duration of the restrictive measures (currently until 31 May 2020), the employer is no longer obliged to send notices of temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure to the competent unemployment office of the NEO. The period may be extended until 30 June 2020 if the public health measures are extended or strengthened by the government.\r\rThe employee may use a simplified form to submit the application for benefits to the designated payment institution.\r\rFrom 01 February 2020 until 30 June 2020, the employee receives a benefit equal to 70% of his average capped salary (capped at \u20ac2,754.76 per month). \r\r\rThe employee who is made temporarily unemployed due to force majeure (reason \"coronavirus\") will receive a supplement of \u20ac5.63 per day on top of the unemployment benefit, from the NEO.\rA withholding tax on professional income of 26.75% is deducted from the benefit. \r",

            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "The National Labour Council provides advice and CA's 147 has been signed which formalizes the measure until the 30th of June.\r\rApart from this agreement and advise there are discussions going on between trade unions and employers. Trade unions claim that some employers abuse temporary unemployment and place sick employees (with sicknesses that have no connection to Corona) within the temporary unemployment sickness system to reduce costs, while in practice this is forbidden and they have to continue to continue to provide guaranteed salary to those employees. Many of these companies that abuse this situation are in fact even still functioning properly despite the Corona measures. ",

The physician sends the form to the Social Insurance Agency. The sick person also must inform his or her employer about the quarantine.There have been differences from the regular sickness benefit applied in other reasons than Covid-19. In these other cases, the first ten days of sick leave are paid by the employer as a wage compensation (25% of gross wage during first three days and 55% of gross wage from the fourth to the 10th day).

Therefore, additional public funding will be made available for usage by public venture capital investors, such as the KfW Capital, the High-Tech Gr\u00fcnderfonds or the European Investment Fund.

Around 25% of persons active in the sector are self-employed or independent artists, without adequate institutional support, so for them the situation is very challenging. Furthermore, there are many single-person owned companies which are also very vulnerable in the current situation. An appeal to government  and local authorities for urgent assistance was launched on 15 March by the Independent theater producers, authors and performers, and the Association of Concert Promoters and signed by  more that 1,300 persons, most of whom are freelancers or independent authors in the sector.\r\r\r",

The government is preparing a proposal for measures for entrepreneurs who will be able to prove the losses incurred in the context of the epidemic. Given the diversity of artistic fields, the Ministry of Culture calls on all professional associations and representatives of the independent cultural sector, in times of crisis identified as particularly fragile, to submit impact assessments so that the proposed measure is as accurate as possible and adapted to all segments of the independent cultural sector and their creators. Around 1,000 people are believed to request financial support from the Ministry. ",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The retail trade is one of the most competitive and most dynamic branches of the Croatian economy. Of the total number of employees in commerce (around 260,000), the majority are employed in retail (around 50%), followed by wholesale trade (40%). Around 80% of employees have an open-ended contract, while only a small minority (around 3%) work part-time. Croatian commerce tried to respond as effectively and efficiently as possible to the wishes and needs of its customers. However, in current situation, employees are particularly vulnerable to infection due to permanent contacts with the customers and many over-time working hours due to the serious shortages of the labour force. \r\rAs a mean to prevent the mingling, reduce possibilities for spreading of virus and possibilities to stipulate working hours, the Law on Amendments to the Trade Act (OG 32/20) defines following: Special circumstances \"means an event or a condition which could not be predicted and could not be affected, which threatens the life and health of citizens, property of high value, significantly damages the environment, disrupts economic activity or causes significant economic damage\". ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Act also empowered the Civil Protection Authority of the Republic of Croatia to determine working hours in trade activities in special circumstances. Indirectly related to the Act, many retail chains in Croatia increased salaries and bonuses and paid out an Easter supplement for their workers in the hope to retain current working force and attract new workers. They also accepted various security measures and equipment to protect their employees from the corona virus. They installed Plexiglas barriers at all cash registers, and have provided security visors to employees at self-service cash register. \r\rWith the intention to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of corona virus infection, the Civil Protection Authority of the Republic of Croatia determine that only shops with food and some other special stores would be opened. Working hours in trade activities are defined from 8 am until 5 pm. ",

As it is hard to find new work for solo self-employed and free lancers and many of their jobs are cancelled during the Corona crisis, the Federal Government opened up the basic income scheme. The new scheme also includes groups that are not truly looking for a new job, but are only temporarily out of business, such as solo self-employed. Applicants for basic income support working as solo self-employed will not have to make any statements on their financial assets and will also not have to tap these assets within the next six months, before being granted basic income support. With the basic income support, they should be able to pay rent or finance their housing. The new rules also provide that application will be provisionally approved and the usual means-testing will be conducted later. In this way, the government hopes to facilitate easier and faster access to these grants.",

Moreover, it introduces a new support instrument (Cassa Integrazione in Deroga, CID) which the benefits all companies with even one employee and simplifies the procedures for activating this measure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Employers who suspend or reduce their activity for events attributable to the Covid-19 epidemic can accede to the Ordinary Wage Guarantee Fund (CIGO) or the Wage Integration Fund (FIS) for a maximum duration of nine weeks starting from 23 February 2020 until the end of August 2020. The periods of utilisation of the CIGO and the FIS for \"Covid-19\" reasons are excluded from the calculation of the maximum duration of ordinary treatments. Moreover, companies making use of the benefit are exempted from the additional contribution that is normally imposed on companies benefiting from wage subsidies. The decree law introduces a special measure (CID) for private employers not covered by the ordinary benefits, i.e. those employing less than 5 employees. However, domestic workers are excluded from the benefit.\rThe amount of the benefit depends on the previous remuneration: for gross monthly wages below \u20ac 2,159.48, the benefit amounts to \u20ac 939.89; for gross monthly wages above \u20ac 2,159.48, the benefit amounts to \u20ac 1,129.48.\rThe maximum spending limit is set at \u20ac 1,347.2 million (for CIGO and FIS) and \u20ac 3,293.2 million (CID), for the year 2020; once reached, INPS will not consider further requests.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "On 9 March 2020, the Romanian Centre for Emergency Situations decided that all schools would be suspended from 11 March 2020 until 22 March 2020 to limit the effects of coronavirus. \rAgainst this background, on the 10 March 2020, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection issued a set of recommendations in order to ensure the health and safety of workers and to support the activity of the employers. These measures mainly concern: flexibilization of the working time, working from home, teleworking.\r\rSoon after this, on the 16 March 2020, the Romanian President has declared a state of emergency \u2013 as a result, schools  remained closed until Orthodox Easter (19 April) initially. After 30 days, the state of emergency was prolonged with another 30 days, till 15 May 2020 - during all this period, the schools remain suspended. This situation left a lot of employees without any immediate solutions to ensure their children supervision and care. To  respond to this problem, the Romanian Parliament passed a law (Law no. 19/2020) requiring employers (both in the public and the private sector) to grant paid leave to one of the parents if schools are closed due to \u201cextreme situations\u201d. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the law 19/2020 , employers must grant employees paid leave if schools are closed in exceptional circumstances, but only if the tasks associated with the employees\u2019 roles cannot be performed in \u201cworking from home\u201d or teleworking conditions. Paid leave can be granted to only one of the parents, and only if the child in care is of maximum 12 years of age (or 18 years of age for children with a disability), who are formally registered as attending courses in a school. \r\rIn some sectors, the parent's request for leave is conditioned by the employer's acceptance (national energy system units, operating units in the nuclear sectors, continuous fire units, health and social care units, telecommunications, public radio and television, rail transport, units that ensure the public transport and sanitation of the localities, as well as the supply of the population with gas, electricity, heat, and water). During such leave, employees will be entitled to a payment of up to 75% of the employee\u2019s base salary, but not more than 75% of the average gross salary in the economy. The allowance is subject to personal income tax and social security contributions (i.e. personal income tax, social security contribution, health insurance contribution and work insurance contribution). \r\rThe net value of the allowance paid by the employer (the amount actually received by the parent) can be recovered from the Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary claims; the corresponding personal income tax and the social security contributions are borne by the employer. To recover the net allowance, employers should submit a request to the local or the Bucharest unemployment agency. ",

As the number of companies applying for partial unemployment has increased significantly since the outbreak of the crisis, the government decided to change the legal framework concerning compensation allowances as far as partial unemployment is concerned. \r\rThe agreement also underlines that the national employers' association UEL did not oppose to the bipartite agreement. \r\r",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "This measure, introduced in the framework of the 'Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act (ZIUZEOP)', in force since 11 April 2020, aims at the protection and retention of jobs. In response to the Covid-19 crisis, the government adopted a \u2018temporary lay-off scheme\u2019 and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure: workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary lay-off), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker\u2019s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer\u2019s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138). \rThe measure being examined, attempting to cushions the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). The state reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations). \rThe maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Only companies with a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020 than in the same periods of 2019 are entitled to reimbursements. If their income is higher, companies will have to pay them back. Not included are organizations with more than 70% of their revenue from the public budget as well as financial and insurance sector. Employment Service will administer requests for compensations from employers.\rFirst reactions show that the rule requesting 20% lower incomes in the first half of 2020 excludes many companies from the support mechanism (Mekina, 2020). Companies which had a high growth of activities up to mid-March will comply with the rule only if their revenue decreases enormously in the following months.",
            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "Trade unions and employers' organizations have submitted many proposals to the measure, mainly for clarifying the definitions. \rMore importantly, employers' organizations proposed the withdrawal of limitations linked to company revenues. They argued that state support shouldn\u2019t stimulate companies to work less. \rTrade unions demanded a fixed period of six months after the epidemic in which employers shouldn\u2019t lay off workers for business reasons. \rSome proposals were accepted but not these two. \rThe law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. Its functioning is, indeed, momentarily blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, has not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council.",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The first law (ZIUPPP, adopted on 20 March 2020) laid down a temporary suspension of social security contributions whose payment deadline expires in April, May, and June 2020. Deferred payment must be paid in two years, until 31 March 2022, in one installment with no interest charge. It is an automatically recognized right meaning that there is no need to submit any claim for obtaining this right. Eligible are self-employed persons (including farmers) who do not employ other workers.\rThe second law (ZIUZEOP, adopted on 2 April 2020) introduces the right of self-employed persons to be fully exempt from paying social security contributions. Among eligible persons there are self-employed, associates, and farmers who have no insurance deriving from other types of employment. They have to make a request to Financial Administration in which they prove 25% lower income in March than in February and 50% lower income in April and May than in February. Later on, beneficiaries will have to pay social security contributions if in the first half of 2020 their revenue exceeds 80% of the revenue in the same period of 2019 and if in the second half of 2020 it exceeds 120% of the revenue in the same period of 2019. \rPostponed and annulled payments of social security contributions are limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims will be possible. \rIn addition to these two measures, self-employed may also claim for deferred payment of income tax.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "While the law (ZIUZEOP) was in parliamentary procedure, non-governmental organizations submitted a proposal that the referential period should not be one month (February), but a more extended period (six months, one year or more years). The argument was that this rule is going to exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. None of their proposals was integrated into the final law.\rTwo cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stress that the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed is not eligible.",
            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "Trade unions and employers' organizations were consulted about the overall scheme of the law, but no one of them submitted proposals linked to this measure. \rThe law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council.

The Association of occupational, transport, and sports medicine also published their own more detailed instructions for companies at its website and offered consultancies on how practically implement safety measures in particular environments. It advised temporary shutdown of the production process if appropriate safety measures could not be adopted. \rThe Labour Inspectorate recommended work at home when feasible.

The argument was that this rule is going to exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have no money inflows in February. None of their proposals was integrated into the final law.\rTwo cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for monthly basic income. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government has suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). These associations stress that not eligible is the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed.",

These measures are new and exceptional, and aimed at extending the COVID-19 quarantine periods with some legal instruments already into force for normal sick-leaves.\r\rThe measures for workers of the private sector have been introduced with the Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 (art. 26). For workers in the public sector, the legal reference is the Decree Law No. 9/2020 of 2 March 2020 (art. 19). ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure sets that the period spent in quarantine by workers in the private sector is equalised to sickness for what concerns its economic treatment, but cannot be calculated within the maximum number of leave days for sickness (i.e. the maximum number of days a worker can stay home for sickness without losing his/her entitlement). The costs for this measure are financed by the State and not by the National Social Security Institute or the employers. \r\rFor workers in the public sector, according to this measure, the period spent in quarantine with active surveillance is equalised to hospitalisation. In this way, the quarantined civil servants are not subject to the deduction set by Article 71 of Law No. 133/2008, that in normal conditions allow them to get an indemnity calculated only on their basic monthly wage, excluding all the additional treatments.",

The agreement aims to ensure the protection of workers' health and the necessary safety conditions in all workplaces, in compliance with the indications formulated by the Ministry of Health on risk management of COVID-19 in the workplace. The protocol was renegotiated and revised on 24 April 2020.\rAlso in order to allow companies to implement the agreement, the Government allocated \u20ac50 million for the purchase of personal protective equipment and tools.

To facilitate the containment of the virus, the agreement allows to suspend or temporary reduce the activity, or to adopt the telework (smart working) as much as possible. The agreement also indicates specific containment measures that follow anti-contagion safety protocols (interpersonal distance between workers or adoption of safety devices). Among these measures are:\r\r1. the use of smart and remote working schemes for the activities that can be carried out at home or remotely; \r2. encouraging the use of paid leave also through collective agreements; \r3. the suspension of the activities of company departments not indispensable for production; \r4. the adoption of anti-contagion safety protocols, the respect the interpersonal distance of one meter as the main measure of containment, the adoption of individual protection tools (e.g. masks and hand sanitizers); \r5. the sanitisation of workplaces and common areas; \r6. limiting to the minimum essential the movement of people inside production sites; \r7. encouraging the negotiation of specific collective agreements for the companies that are still in production; \r8. the establishment of a company committee with the participation of employees' workplace representatives for monitoring the application of the protocol. \r\rThe protocol was renegotiated and revised on 24 April 2020. The main amendments concerned the following issues: \r\r9. the non-application of the Protocol - which results in the inability to guarantee adequate levels of protection - determines the suspension of the activity until conditions of safety are restored\r10. the supervision of the client company on compliance with the provisions also with regard to the staff of third-party companies operating in the client's premises/construction sites\r11. attention to the mode of transport to reach the workplace.\r\rFurthermore, the \u20ac50 million allocated by the Government to undertakings to implement the agreement will be distributed, upon request, by the National Agency for inward investment promotion and enterprise development (INVITALIA).

In the same day, INVITALIA received 59,025 demands from 42.753 companies, allocating almost all the available funds.",

By giving priority attention to the health of people in the workplace, this will also allow us to overcome this delicate phase and prepare for the economic recovery as soon as we get out of it\".\r\rThe Secretary General of CISL - one of the principal Italian trade unions - expressed satisfaction for the protocol and its revision arguing that \"the agreement summarizes the indications of Inail and the National Scientific Technical Committee and at the same time strengthens and expands the contents of the Protocol of 14 March for measures to contrast and contain the spread of the virus in the workplace. After a very long and complex negotiation with the employers' associations, we found a balanced and responsible synthesis through the insertion of very innovative actions and procedures necessary for the improvement of interventions aimed at guaranteeing stable rules and conditions for the safety and health protection of workers. in the workplace\".",

In the context of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the system was relaxed.The partial activity is intended for all employees who suffer a reduction in remuneration attributable to :\r- either a reduction in the working hours practiced in the establishment or part of the establishment below the legal working hours (35 hours);\r- a temporary closure of all or part of the establishment.\r\rRequests for partial activity are made by employers if the drop in activity is caused by one of the reasons referred to in Article R. 5122-1 of the Labour Code, including circumstances of an exceptional nature, which apply in the present crisis.\r\rDuring the period of partial activity :\r- The employer receives from the public authorities (Services and Payment Agency - ASP) an allowance equivalent to a share of the hourly pay of the employee placed in partial activity;\r- The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The short-time working scheme cover all employees of the private sector. \rWith the new provisions adopted to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the partial activity allowance paid by the State to the company - co-financed by the State and by the joint body that manages the unemployment insurance scheme (Un\u00e9dic) - is no longer a lump sum, but is proportional to the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity. \rThe 'remainder payable' by the employer, i.e. the amount of the remuneration which the employer must pay to the employee, is zero for all employees whose remuneration is less than 4.5 gross SMIC (\u20ac45.68 per hour or \u20ac6,927.39 per month).\rThe compensation due to the employee covers at least 70% of his previous gross remuneration, i.e. approximately 84% of the net salary.\r\rThere is nothing to prevent an employer from compensating its employees in excess of 70% of gross salary if it can/wishes to do so or if a collective or company-level agreement so provides.\r\rIn all cases, a minimum of \u20ac8.03 per hour is respected.\r\rSpecific measures are planned for employees of private employers (cleaning ladies) and childcare assistants (who look after young children) who are usually paid by the hour with a job voucher system.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of April 7, 2020, 692,000 applications for partial activity have been filed. They concern 669,000 establishments and 6,300,000 employees (2.3 million more than on 31 March).  About 59% of employees who have applied for partial activity since 1 March work in establishments with fewer than 50 employees. These establishments account for 34% of private salaried employment. Conversely, those working in establishments with more than 250 employees account for 15% of employees in partial activity, while these establishments account for 20% of private salaried employment.\rThe Ministry of Labour (DARES and DGEFP) and the public employment service P\u00f4le Emploi have decided to update these data every weeks.

The regular length of ordinary alternative civilian service is nine months, with some compensation provided.)

In addition, former civil servants are recruited voluntarily for full-time positions (at least 40 hours per week, overtime can be added) from May or June 2020 for a duration of two to three months.\rWhile regular civil servants who have been mandatorily extended receive their regular remuneration (\u20ac346.70) plus supplement of  \u20ac189.90 (tax free), the newly recruited voluntary former civil servants receive in addition to this a flat-rate compensation of almost \u20ac1,300 (gross).

However, as agriculture is one of the supply-critical sectors in the current COVID-19 crisis, many seasonal workers, for some of whom employment permits have already been issued, are unable to enter Austria due to travel restrictions and cannot start work as planned.

It was updated on 22 March to include commuters entering from Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia. The regulation basically states that persons entering Austria from one of these countries must carry a medical certificate (in German, English, Italian or French) on their state of health and show that the molecular biological test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative. The medical certificate must not be more than four days old at the time of entry. Persons who are unable to present such a certificate shall be refused entry.

Teleworking is a right provided for in Article L. 1222-9 of the Labour Code, resulting from the Order of 22 September 2017, and must be favoured in phase 3 of the epidemic. An employee can therefore ask his employer to benefit from telework until further notice. The employer may refuse, but reasons must be given for the refusal.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Since the passage to stage 3 of the epidemic, the implementation of telework must be imperative as soon as the workstation allows it. Telework can be implemented when the workstation layout is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity and to guarantee the protection of employees.\r\rArticle L. 1222-11 of the Labour Code mentions the risk of an epidemic as a possible justification for the use of telework without the employee's agreement. The implementation of telework in this context does not require any particular formalism.\r\rIn a circular, the ministry of Labour estimate the employee must receive an allowance intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework: 'In the context of the current health crisis \u2013 since telework is carried out, in the majority of cases, over the entire actual working time and is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity, to guarantee the protection of employees and for reasons of public health \u2013 it should be considered that the employer is obliged to pay his employee a telework allowance, intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework'. Indeed, the employer has an obligation to bear the professional expenses. This obligation is provided for without restriction by the case-law, which is of general application and must cover teleworkers.\r\r'However, adds the ministry of Labour, in view of the difficulty of identifying and circumscribing the expenses relating to the professional activity and those relating to personal life, it is in the employer's interest to favour a lump sum which will simplify its management'.\r\rIf the allowance paid by the employer is a lump sum, it will then be deemed to be used in accordance with its purpose and will be exempt from social security contributions up to an overall limit of \u20ac10/month for an employee who teleworks one day per week. This exempt lump-sum allowance increases to \u20ac20/month for an employee teleworking two days a week, \u20ac30/month for 3 days a week, etc.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In 2017, about 3.0% of employees were teleworking at least once a week. According to an INSEE economic report published on 26 March 2020, i.e. ten days after the start of confinement, approximately one third of employees are working at their usual place of work, one third are teleworking and the last third are on short-time working. On 15 March, in a press release, the Ministry of Labour estimates that close to 8 million jobs (or more than four out of ten jobs) are compatible with telework in the private sector.",

Nevertheless, in the same time, it denounces the government's decision to provide, at the level of the sectors defined as \"essential\", that not only can the employer refuse requests for leave (as has been the case since March 18), but that he can now even cancel any leave already granted to the employee. This is contrary to all relevant case law as well as to the principle of mutual agreements between employer and employees.",

The measure aims at protecting companies from bankruptcies due to negative consequences of the epidemic.

Other changes tackle compensation of unpaid wages from the Guarantee Fund, personal bankruptcy procedures, and enforcement proceedings.",

The management can abstain from the duty if the company becomes insolvent due to the state, ministry or local authority\u2019s ban on production or trade.\r \rOn the other hand, the law reinforces some workers\u2019 rights. \rWhen a company gets workers' wages reimbursed it must transfer them to employees within one month at the latest. If not, it is presumed no longer solvent in compulsory settlement or bankruptcy procedure.\r\rWorkers can then also get easier access to the funds of the 'Public Scholarship, Development, Disability and Maintenance Fund' of the Republic of Slovenia (Guarantee Fund) for unpaid wages in the last three months, unpaid sick leave, annual holidays or severance payment. Employees fulfill the condition for acquiring rights if they prove that an application has been filed against the employer for the initiation of a bankruptcy proceeding (and not the final decision to initiate bankruptcy proceeding).\r\rFinally, for the time of the epidemic, enforcement proceedings are temporarily postponed.",

It is thus covered by a limited set of labour rights, like the ban on discrimination and harassment, the interdiction of child work, rules on working time, breaks, and rest periods, the prohibition of work for some specific groups. The Agricultural Act explicitly mentions viticulture, fruit growing, hop growing, and vegetable growing as sectors much in need of such unprotected and occasional labour force.\r\rThe 2020 provisions lifting restrictions to the utilization of temporary work in agriculture have been introduced to put a remedy to the shortage of immigrant workers in the agricultural sector, due to the limitations to cross-border movements caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. ",

It means that such type of work can be carried out without restriction all year. \rThe emergency regulation also stipulates that Public Employment Service may assign temporary work in agriculture to temporary laid-off persons. \rUpon the request of agricultural enterprise, the Public Employment Service sends to work a person who is temporary laid-off due to the epidemic",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Hop growers report on troubles due to labour shortage after the ban on the border crossing. They say that the sector relies on Rumanian seasonal agricultural workers who are no more allowed to come.

Its functioning is momentarily blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, has not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. ",

Financial support should be equal to real damage, but cannot exceed 80% of the minimum wage.\rEmergency regulation endows agricultural businesses with the right to financial compensation for the loss of income during the epidemic. The loss of income means the inability of selling supply or lower scale of production if it causes a decrease in revenue by 20%. Agricultural businesses may claim for financial support for the time of epidemic as well as for three succeeding months. The calculation of compensation will be based on a flat rate taking into consideration the number of hectares or livestock units or average catch in the last three years. This support is not compatible with another support under emergency regulation, the monthly basic income (see \u2018Monthly basic income\u2019), as one rules out the other.\rThe law obliges public institutions to buy at least 50% of agricultural products from local growers if the purchase value does not exceed a determined sum when the public procurement has to appear in the Official Journal of the European Union. Local food means that it is produced and processed locally. The obligatory purchase of local food will be valid until the end of 2020.",

These derogations from the Labour Code have been adopted through the Ordonnance No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, and can be implemented until 31 December 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In order to deal with the economic, financial and social consequences of the spread of COVID-19, the Ordinance provides that a collective company agreement or, failing that, a branch agreement, may:\r\u25cf Authorise the employer to impose the taking of paid leave, up to a limit of 6 days (i.e. 1 week's paid leave). In this case, the employer must respect a period of notice of at least 1 clear day (as against 1 month in normal times). This provision covers both acquired leave and leave in the process of being acquired (i.e. it may be taken even before the start of the leave period).\u25cf Authorize the employer to unilaterally modify the dates of taking paid leave up to a limit of 6 days. This provision relates to paid leave already taken by the employee. The employer must respect a notice period of at least 1 clear day (compared to one month in normal times). In the absence of a collective agreement, the law already allows the employer to do so without observing the one month's notice period, in exceptional circumstances as is currently the case.\u25cf Authorise the employer to impose the splitting of the main leave when it exceeds 12 days, without the employee's agreement.\rApart from the derogations from the rules on paid leave set out above, which imply a collective agreement, the employer may impose (without the need for a collective agreement) or modify the taking of the other rest days (provided for in a collective agreement on the reduction of working time, provided for in an agreement on the organisation of working time or provided for in a lump-sum-day agreement which exists for employees whose actual working time cannot be determined). In addition, the employer may impose the taking of rest days placed in a time-saving account.\rThe Ordinance provides for two limits: \r1. The employer must give the employee one day's notice. \r2. Derogations may concern a maximum of 10 rest days by 31 December 2020.\rThe employer, additionally, may set the dates of leave without taking into account the simultaneous leave entitlements of spouses employed in the same company. The employer may dissociate their leaves if the presence of only one of the two spouses is indispensable to the company, or if one of them has already exhausted his or her paid leave (normally the Labour Code provides that spouses or partners who are employees of the same company are entitled to simultaneous leave).\r\rFinally, the ordinance allows the employer (without collective agreement) to derogate to the Sunday rest. He is allowed to ask employees to work on Sunday. These derogations do not apply to all undertakings, however. They concern firms in sectors deemed essential to the continuity of economic life and national security (the list of which will be laid down by decree) and firms which provide the above mentioned with services necessary for the performance of their main activity. Provisions also apply to companies located in the departments of LaMoselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin, which were hard hit by the Covid crisis.",

The new amendment gives a legal right to an unemployed person to receive unemployment benefits from the state and at the same time work at a rural stop and take a salary from there.\r\rAccording to unofficial information, the Ministry of Agriculture is also discussing the possibility of workers in enterprises that have been introduced to reduced working hours due to the coronavirus crisis and are being compensated under the 60/40 scheme, to be able to start additional work in agriculture",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "People receiving unemployment or social assistance benefits can earn additional income from seasonal work in agriculture without losing their entitlement to state support. Those who are currently on unpaid leave can also sign a second employment contract without permission from their primary employer. These are the two approved measures that, at the threshold of the active season in agriculture, should divert employees to this sector.\r\rAmendments to the Emergency Legislation adopted in April 2020 introduce the possibility for farmers to conclude temporary employment contracts similar to one-day contracts to hire employees for activities such as harvesting. The key change in this case is that the conclusion of such contracts would not affect the receipt of unemployment benefits or social benefits by employees, which in previous years was a serious obstacle to securing seasonal workers on the field.\r\rCurrently, there is also no limit to the length of time that employees can work under the second employment contract while on unpaid leave.

This premium is not subject to income tax. This scheme has been renewed in 2020, but is reserved for employers who have set up a profit-sharing scheme in the company's results (\"int\u00e9ressement\"). However, this scheme has been modified to take into account the COVID-19 crisis to support purchase power of employees working during the crisis in essential services and all other companies that have stayed open.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to an ordinance dated 1 April 2020 published in the context of the health crisis, the exceptional purchasing power bonus, that is exempted of social contribution and tax-free, can reach \u20ac2,000 for companies that have set up a profit-sharing agreement. Those that do not have one can nevertheless pay the exceptional bonus, but within the limit of \u20ac1,000. \r\rOn the basis of the Article 11 of the emergency law of 23 March 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, an ordinance published on 2 April 2020 relaxes the conditions for payment of the exceptional purchasing power bonus provided for in Article 7 of the law on the financing of social security for 2020 (LFSS 2020). \r\rThe aim is to encourage companies to make use of this scheme in the context of the epidemic, bearing in mind that the premium can now be paid until 31 August 2020 (instead of 30 June).\rCompanies that do not have a profit-sharing agreement ('accord d'int\u00e9ressement') can use the bonus by benefiting from these exemptions, if the amount paid does not exceed \u20ac1,000. Until now, these companies have been excluded from the measure.\rFor companies which implement a profit-sharing agreement on the date of payment of the bonus, the maximum amount exempted is \u20ac2,000 (instead of \u20ac1,000 up to now). The profit-sharing agreement may be for a period of between one and three years if it was concluded between 1 January and 31 August 2020, with the deadline of 30 June 2020 being extended. \rInitially, the exceptional purchase power bonus scheme allowed its amount to be modulated between employees according to remuneration, classification level, length of actual presence during the year or the working time provided for in the employment contract. The ordinance provides for a new possibility of modulation, depending on 'working conditions related to the Covid-19 epidemic'. According to the Ministry of Labour, this new possibility was intended in particular to give companies the possibility of rewarding more people who, for example, are forced to go to their workplace than those who are not obliged to do so",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "So far, only 37,000 companies have paid a bonus in 2020. The Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire call to reward employees 'who had the courage to go to their workplace' despite the health crisis.\rParticularly targeted, large retailers seems to have received the message: Auchan, Carrefour, Intermarch\u00e9, Lidl, Syst\u00e8me U and Leclerc have already announced that their employees would receive a bonus of \u20ac1,000. The same goes for the 15,000 Veolia employees who remained in the field to manage water and waste, or for 5,000 employees of the Total group.\rIt should be noted that some companies have not yet made their decision, waiting in particular to assess the effects of the crisis on their cash flow: they now have until August 31 to do so (compared to June 30 initially).",

Over 60% of holders of family agricultural holdings are over 55 and less than 4 % under 35. The economic crisis and the previous wartime events have contributed to migratory movements from rural to urban areas, particularly of the younger population, resulting in a general decline in the rural population and an increase in the ageing population. This poses a serious threat to the further development and even survival of the rural areas themselves. Young people are a key resource for the development of a modern and competitive agricultural sector, primarily because of their willingness and ability to adapt easily to technological changes, new practices and changing market conditions which is a requirement to increase productivity and competitiveness. Some achieved progress has come under the question due to the recent crisis.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The target groups of financial instruments Micro loans for rural development are primarily small business entities in the agricultural, processing and forestry sectors. Loans can be obtained in the amount of \u20ac 1,000 to \u20ac 25,000 and the funds are provided from the Rural Development Program. The repayment period is up to three years with an interest rate of 0.5 percent and a grace period of up to 12 months. The measure offers the possibility of settling bills created up to three months before the loan application is received, with significantly less documentation and a prepared Business Plan form. The Business Plan form is quite simple with pages on two-page questions, which significantly shortens the time of preparation of the application and enables easier and faster processing. \r\rDue to restricted movement of possible beneficiaries and with the desire to simplify the procedure, the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO) recommends on-line applications. The used of these loans can be an important step in improving the economic performance of farms and facilitating farm restructuring and modernization, notably with a view to increasing market participation and orientation. Furthermore, such financial sources can be of crucial importance to needed agricultural diversification. ",

According to the Croatian Bureau of Statistic, about  6,400 people are employed in the sector, approximately 3.4 percent of the total population. There are two major problems: the inability to conclude the competition in the 2019-2020 season and the existence of a large number of sports associations and clubs which, because of the loss of revenue, have difficulties to continue the payment of wages to workers.",

For the duration of the special circumstances, the support for preserving jobs in the sports sector affected by coronavirus will be disbursed. The amount of the support is to HRK 3,250 (\u20ac 433) per employees for March 2020, and HRK 4,000 (\u20ac 533) for April and May 2020. The measure is intended to preserve the system of competition and sport during the special circumstances. The Government submitted to the parliamentary procedure amendments to the Act on Sport which enables the Office to allow grants to clubs.\r\rThe responsible authority for the implementation of measure is the Central State Office for Sport. The redistribution within the budget of the State Office for Sport provided HRK 40 million (\u20ac 5.33 million) to help sports clubs to mitigate the consequences caused by the coronavirus epidemic. These measures do not require additional resources or special funds, but they are secured by a redistribution within the adopted budget of the Office. Amendments to the Act on Sport ensure the regularity of the competition by enabling a shorter period of one year for the adoption of regulations and competition systems. ",

Since the beginning of the global pandemic crisis, the company actively monitors the situation and continuously takes the necessary action to preserve employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 health, jobs and insure the business continuity. Following the tightening of general prevention measures by the competent authorities, Valamar closed in March 2020 all hotels and restaurants. With the aim of preserving jobs and business continuity in the conditions where touristic activities were completely suspended, Valamar made the decision to launch  the \"PAUSE, RESTART\" program. It started on 1 April and will last at least 30 to possible 90 days. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The program covers all employees, therefore there will be no layoffs for about 2,800 workers in Valamar. Government support will be used. All employees who cannot work due to the situation will be  referred to PAUSE from April 1. During the PAUSE, employees will be provided with a salary compensation in the amount of minimum 60% of regular salary, but not less than HRK 4,250 net (\u20ac 567). This measure will apply equally to employees and management including permanent and seasonal workers. During the PAUSE, a part of employees and management in charge of the crisis will work primarily on maintenance, conservation and facility security duties, while a part of the staff will communicate with guests and partners. The wages of management will be reduced by up to 30% until all employees return to work. Other employees who will work full-time will continue to receive their regular full pay.\r\rThe Management Board cancelled the General Assembly and with the consent of the Supervisory Board proposed to the General Assembly a withdrawal of dividend payment and to direct these sources into funds for increase liquidity and support measures for the preservation of all jobs. Until the situation improves, Valamar Riviera cannot provide regular services but the company\u2019s goal is not to lose any employee. To prepare on time for RESTART, the company directs its efforts to the development of a new business plan and the preparation of facilities for the start of touristic season. ",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This temporary\u00a0scheme aims to allow\u00a0small and medium\u00a0businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million, which\u00a0are experiencing lost or deferred revenues to access\u00a0loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to \u00a35 million for up to 6 years.The government will also make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender-levied fees. This means smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments.The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to pre-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs.The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank.\u00a0There are 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks, as well as\u00a0challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders.\u00a0 \r\rA business is eligible if:\r\r\u2022it is based in the UK\u2022has an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million\u2022has a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, if not for the coronavirus pandemic. \r\rTo access the scheme, businesses should approach their own provider \u2013 ideally via the lender\u2019s website. They may also consider approaching other lenders if they are unable to access the finance they need.\u00a0 Decision-making on eligibility for CBILS is fully delegated to the accredited CBILS lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain\u2019s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.\r\rFinance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years.\u00a0The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.\r\rAt the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of GBP 250,000 and under. Initially, the eligibility criteria stated that for facilities above GBP 250,000, the lender must establish a lack or absence of security prior to businesses using CBILS. It also stated that if the lender could offer finance on normal commercial terms without the need to make use of the scheme, they should do so. \r\rHowever, these\u00a0were changed as the scheme progressed. Thus, on the 2 April 2020, the\u00a0Government made changes to the scheme, namely:\r\r\u2022 No personal guarantees for facilities under GBP 250k: Personal guarantees of any form cannot be taken under the scheme for any facilities below GBP 250k.\r\u2022 Personal guarantees for facilities above GBP 250k: Personal guarantees may still be required, at a lender\u2019s discretion, but recoveries under these are capped at a maximum of 20% of the outstanding balance of the CBILS facility after the proceeds of business assets have been applied. A Principal Private Residence (PPR) cannot be taken as security to support a personal guarantee or as security for a CBIL backed facility.\r\u2022 Security: For all facilities, including those over GBP 250,000, CBILS can now support lending to smaller businesses even where a lender considers there to be sufficient security, making more smaller businesses eligible to receive the business interruption payment.\r\rThe Government announced that these changes should be retrospectively applied by lenders for any CBILS facilities offered since 23 March 2020. For any commercial (non-CBILS) facilities offered since the same date, providing the borrower meets the CBILS eligibility criteria, lenders have been asked to bring these facilities onto CBILS wherever possible (e.g. where the lender is accredited to offer the same facility through CBILS) and changes retrospectively applied as necessary.\r",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "As part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). This recognises that prior to the crisis, companies often sell short-term debt ('commercial paper') to the market as a quick and effective way of raising working capital/ Thus, under CCFF, the Bank of England will instead buy this short-term debt.\r\rThe scheme then aims to \"\u2026help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, even while experiencing severe disruption to cashflows.\u00a0 The facility will offer financing on terms comparable to those prevailing in markets in the period before the Covid-19 economic shock, and will be open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the shock. The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms\u2019 balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms\u2019 credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.\"\r\rSo the scheme will\u00a0support companies which are fundamentally strong, but have been affected by a short-term funding squeeze, enabling them to continue financing their short-term liabilities. It is also designed to\u00a0support corporate finance markets overall and ease the supply of credit to all firms.\r\r\rThe scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way. It will operate for at least 12 months. The Bank of England has set out overall guidance about eligibility and notes that the scheme is \u201cnormally\u201d intended for:\r\rUK incorporated companies, including those with foreign-incorporated parents and with a genuine business in the UK; companies with significant employment in the UK; firms with their headquarters in the UK. It\u00a0will also consider whether the company generates significant revenues in the UK, serves a large number of customers in the UK or has a number of operating sites in the UK.\u00a0 Thus, companies \u2013 and their finance subsidiaries \u2013 that make a material contribution to the UK economy are eligible\u00a0to participate.\r\rUK Finance provides further coordination of the scheme and lists main contacts.",

Section 39 is the relevant regulation (which amends The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992); this section gives the\u00a0Secretary of State the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In Budget 2020, the UK Government\u00a0announced that\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be met in full for up to 14 days per employee. The Chancellor estimates that this will cost up to \u00a32 billion and help up to 2 million businesses. In its factsheet on government support for those affected by Covid-19, HM Treasury said that the eligibility criteria for the scheme would be as follows:\r\r\u2022 this refund will cover up to 2 weeks\u2019 SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19;\r\u2022 employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible;\u00a0the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020;\r\u2022 employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19;\r\u2022 employers should maintain records of staff absences, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note;\r\u2022 eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolators comes into force;\r\u2022 the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible. Existing systems are not designed to facilitate employer refunds for SSP47.\r\rSSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at GBP 94.25 per week (GBP 95.85 from 6 April 2020) and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. In order to\u00a0qualify for SSP, an\u00a0employee\u2019s average weekly earnings must be above GBP 118 (GBP 120 from 6 April 2020). Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. \r\rThe Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/287) came into force on 13 March 2020. These Regulations (as amended) make it clear in law that employees are entitled to SSP if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating as a result of them or someone in their household showing symptoms of coronavirus.\u00a0 Normally, SSP is paid from the fourth day of absence. However, on the\u00a028 March, the Government made the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/374). These provide that SSP is payable from the first day of absence where a worker is self-isolating because they or someone in their household has shown symptoms of coronavirus. The Regulations have retrospective from 13 March 2020.\rUnder the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.\r\rRegulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\r\rThe guidance says that employers will be covered in the following circumstances: If employers are:\u00a0\r\r\u2022 claiming for an employee who\u2019s eligible for sick pay due to coronavirus\r\u2022 had a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started on or before 28 February 2020\r\u2022 had fewer than 250 employees on 28 February 2020.\r\rThe scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:\r\u2022 full-time employees\r\u2022 part-time employees\r\u2022 employees on agency contracts\r\u2022 employees on flexible or zero-hour contracts\r",

Due to the current travel restrictions in Finland and elsewhere, entry of foreign workforce,and in particular seasonal workforce to the country, is limited. \r\rDue to the outbreak of COVID-19, many workers will be either temporarily laid off or dismissed. This applies especially to the travel, restaurant and culture sectors where many foreigners work. Dismissed or temporarily laid-off workers experience particular challenges as residence permits granted on the basis of work are tied to employment. \r\rRestrictions established in Ulkomaalaislaki (the Alien Act) (301/2004) and other relevant acts that regulate the rights of  foreign workforce limit the right of workers who come outside of EU/EEA to change employer or sector. In order to change employer or sector, they normally need to apply for a permission. \r\rTemporary amendments to these Acts give foreign workers (outside of EU/EEA) already residing in Finland a temporary right to work in essential sectors and roles without the need to apply for a permission when changing employer or sector.

Futhermore, the Minister of Labour announced the postponement of the entry into force of the second part of the unemployment insurance reform, initially scheduled for 1 April 2020. The new rules, which modified the calculations of the duration of compensation and the reference daily wage used to determine the amount of the back-to-work allowance, are therefore postponed to an entry into force on 1 September 2020. These rules are less favourable to jobseekers.",

This additional compensation will not reduce any future entitlements.\rThe extension is automatic on the part of public employment service (P\u00f4le Emploi) and is effective for payments since the beginning of April. \r\rJobseekers are still required to keep up to date. On the other hand, job search monitoring is suspended during the entire period of confinement. No jobseeker will be struck off the list or sanctioned during this period, ensures a question and answer published on the P\u00f4le emploi website.\r\rA decree published on 14 April provides that the payment of benefits to the unemployed at the end of their rights will go at least 'until the end of the calendar month in which the end of the confinement occurs', details the Ministry of Labour. At this stage, it would therefore be until 31 May 2020. But 'this date will be extended in case of a new extension of the containment measure', the ministry specifies.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the daily Les Echos, between 60,000 and 90,000 jobseekers should arrive at the end of the allowance period in March. It can be estimated a similar number of April. The measure could support from 150,000 to 250,000 jobseekers if the confinement period ends, as expected, on 11 May 2020.",

All VAT-registered businesses will be eligible. Taxpayers will be given until the end of the 2020-21 tax year to pay any liabilities that have accumulated during the deferral period. VAT refunds and reclaims will be paid by the government as normal. HMRC have advised that customers who normally pay by direct debit should cancel their direct debit with their bank if they are unable to pay. They should do in sufficient time so that HMRC do not attempt to automatically collect on receipt of your VAT return.\r\rOn 26 March, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs\u00a0(HMRC) issued further guidance on this scheme. This underlines that HMRC will not charge interest or penalties on any amount deferred as a result of the Chancellor\u2019s announcement. Businesses will still need to submit their VAT returns on time. VAT payments due following the end of the deferral period will have to be paid as normal, and HMRC have stated that further information about how to repay deferred VAT will be available soon.\r\r\r\r\r\rGenerally",

As a result of this, temporary amendments to the Unemployment Security Act and other related Acts have been made. These amendments remove the waiting period in the sense that job-seekers will receive benefits from day one of the unemployment period. During this period, the state will cover for the expenses (after the waiting period unemployment funds will cover parts of the earnings-related unemployment allowance of their members). \r\r",

As for usual, persons who are laid off temporarily or dismissed (either for personal reasons or financial or production-related reasons) need to register with the TE-services as unemployed job-seekers on the first day of the lay-off or unemployment period. \r\rAlso during the waiting period the amount of financial support is dependent on whether the job-seeker is a member of an unemployment fund and meets the specific criteria (temporary changes due to COVID-19 has been made) and can apply for earnings-related or basic unemployment allowance or not. Those who do not qualify for earnings-related or basic unemployment benefit receive labour market subsidy. \r\rThe temporary removal of the waiting period applies to cases where the waiting period has started between 16 March 2020 and 7 July 2020.

Employees on short time work will receive public money to support their livelihood when not working. Companies on the other hand will not have to pay wages for hours not worked and still be able to keep their workers on board and not lay them off. Changed rules on short time work were implemented by a government ordinance based on the act to enhance the regulations governing short-time work allowance for a limited period as a result of the crisis (Gesetz zur befristeten krisenbedingten Verbesserung der Regelungen f\u00fcr das Kurzarbeitergeld). The improved short-time working scheme is part of a broader rescue package adopted by the Federal Government at the end of March 2020, in order to cushion the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the closure of many businesses. The rescue package also includes other measures, such as easier access to loans for companies, eased up tax and insolvency rules, financial assistance for solo- or micro-entrepreneurs, support for hospitals and other critical infrastructure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new rules took effect in retrospect on 1 March 2020. Companies that are faced with a decline in orders due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and shut-down of businesses, can apply for short time work, if at least 10% of its workforce could be affected by the lack of work. This limit was lowered from 30%. Before short time work can be granted, any remaining hours on workers' working time accounts have to be depleted. If short time work is granted, employees will receive 60% of their net income (67% if having children) for all hours not worked. The short-time working allowance is paid by the local employment agency for a maximum of 12 months.To lower the remaining costs, the federal government also decided that social insurance contributions usually paid by employers for their employees, will be fully reimbursed by the Federal Employment Agency. The new rules apply to dependent employees and will also be made available to temporary agency workers.",

In this case, the employer can (but does not have to) order the consumption of leave within the following framework:\r- leave entitlement from previous years in full;\r- leave entitlements from the current leave year to a maximum of two weeks;\rIn total, a maximum of 8 weeks of leave and time off in lieu can be order unilaterally by the employer.\r\rThe Civil Code of Austria (ABGB) was changed accordingly in order to allow for this crisis measure.",

In addition, the company uses mobile nebulizers spraying disinfectants e.g. in old people's homes.",

Use in production halls, stadiums, train stations, airfields or event halls is conceivable.\rFor smaller areas and spaces, the company also works with mobile nebulizers. So far, a snow cannon has been adapted accordingly. It should already be in use next week. There are five of the mobile nebulizers, some of which are already being used, for example in old people's homes.\rOn 31 March, a decree by the Ministry of Health created the basis for this unorthodox measure, said the DAKA. According to this, from 6 April  surfaces and devices that are regularly touched by customers must be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis. 'Of course, manual wiping is the best method', DAKA project manager Matthias Zitterbart admitted in an interview, but this is 'very expensive'.\rSwiveling snow cannons loaded with hydrogen peroxide with a throw of up to fifty meters are said to bring relief. 'It can be used to disinfect large areas within a very short time', emphasized Zitterbart. For example, dosing tanks and high-pressure pumps had to be integrated into the snow cannon.\rThe mobile nebulizers are used for smaller areas, including offices or pharmacies. 'The second smallest devices work autonomously'. said the DAKA project manager. The room was accessible again ninety minutes after the disinfection process.

No workers who are not required for operations are allowed on the factory premises. As far as possible, work for other employees is to be provided in the home office. Precautions have been taken for possible quarantine cases. Certain areas of the plant, such as crane systems in the waste incineration plants, could be operated in part automatically. ",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In a press release dated 3 April 2020, the Minister of Action and Public Accounts announced the extension of the contribution deferral measures for the April social security payments. Thus, employers that had to pay social contribution on 15 April could defer all or part of the payment of their employee and employer contributions. This deferral of contributions is not automatic and implies an action to modify the payment order or transfer.\r\rFor the self-employed, the monthly due dates of 20 March and 5 April were not deducted in order to relieve their cash flow. Pending further action, the amount of this due date will be smoothed over subsequent due dates (April to December). In addition to this measure, self-employed workers may request: 1/ the granting of payment deadlines, including by anticipation. There will be no late payment increase or penalty; 2/ an adjustment of their contribution schedule to take account of a drop in their income, by re-estimating their income without waiting for the annual declaration; 3/ Intervention by the social action for the partial or total payment of their contributions or for the allocation of exceptional financial aid.\r\rOther measure allow the employer to postpone some tax payments.",

This minimum limit has now been lowered to allow a larger number of part-time workers to become eligible.\r\rBoth the highest and the lowest amounts paid out by an unemployment insurance fund have been raised temporarily to alleviate the economic impact on people who become unemployed (the highest from SEK 20,000 to SEK 26,400 per month, and lowest from SEK 365 to SEK 510 per day).

This reduction applies to up to 30 employees and on that portion of the employee\u2019s wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month. This entails tax relief of up to SEK 5 300 per employee and month. To provide equivalent relief to sole traders, a reduction of individual contributions has also been introduced. The proposal\u2019s cost to public finances are estimated to SEK 33 billion.\r\rThe rules came into force on 6 April.

This proposal concerns sole traders and natural persons who are partners in Swedish partnerships. \r\rAdditionally, all companies are now able to defer payments of employer contributions, preliminary tax on salary and value added tax, reported monthly or quarterly. The companies' deferral includes three months' tax payments and may be submitted for a maximum of 12 months.\r\rThe new rules are proposed to take effect on 7 April 2020 but can be applied retroactively from 1 January 2020, meaning that companies that have paid tax into their tax account in February and March can get the tax refunded from the Swedish Tax Agency.\r\rPostponement will not be granted to companies that mismanage their finances or are otherwise dishonest.

The new system means that individual employers affected by temporary and serious financial difficulties that could not reasonably have been foreseen or avoided will be able to receive support for a limited period of time. The aim of the measure is thus to dampen the effect of the ongoing health crisis and save jobs by easing the financial burden of wage costs for companies experiencing difficulties. \r\rShort-time work (also known as short-time layoffs) is regulated in the Act (2013:948) on short-time work (Lag (2013:948) om st\u00f6d vid korttidsarbete).\r\rNB!

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Short-time working means that employers can reduce their employees\u2019 working hours and receive financial support from the central government to compensate for a significant part of the costs for retaining the employee. \r\rWorking-time can be reduced by up to 60% (although this is likely to shortly be extended to 80%). The support is intended to correspond to 75% of the employer\u2019s costs after the reduced working hours. The basis of calculation is ordinary salary (or wage for hourly employees) excluding the employer\u2019s social insurance contributions, however to still take the statutory employer\u2019s social insurance contributions of 31.42% into account, the share of support will be 98.6%, i.e. 75% of 1.3142 = 98.565%.\r\rThe application to receive such support opened on April 7 but will be retroactively applied to as early as from 16 March.\r\rEmployers wishing introduce short-time work must first ensure that they have the possibility for short-time working in their central and local collective bargaining agreement. Employers whose employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement must instead sign an agreement for short-time working covering at least 70% of the employees at the operating unit. ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The use of short-term work is likely to be widespread. One day after the application openened, the administrating authority - The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth - had already received 15,000 applications. ",

Those who do not yet have one can get one through their 'Finanzonline' account or with their Citizen Card. Those who have neither access to 'Finanzonline' nor a citizen card can apply for an electronic AMS account by email or phone. Then, however, the processing can take a few days. If waiting is not an option, unemployed can also register as unemployed using a form on the AMS website. It is also possible to report unemployment by email. The last option is to call the AMS to have the necessary forms sent to you by post.\r\rFor those who receive unemployment benefits and the entitlement period would come to an end (thus receiving the lower emergency assistance), the 'Corona crisis period' is not calculated towards this entitlement, i.e. unemployment benefits are prolonged for the duration of the crisis.",

From 15 April 2020, parents who had been employed until 28 February and are now on  short-time work or have become unemployed due to the crisis are eligible. Self-employed persons with losses could also apply for payment. This applies to families with children who receive family allowance. The payment is valid for three months, but is paid once at the beginning and does not have to be paid back.\r\rThe exact amount of support depends on previous income. Aschbacher cited as an example a family with two children and \u20ac3,000 net family income, which would receive \u20ac780 for three months after the father's unemployment.

The landlord may not claim the arrears of payment in court until the end of 31 December 2020 or cover them from a deposit handed over by the tenant.\rIn addition, the landlord may not legally demand payment of rent due between 1 April and 30 June 2020 until the end of 31 December 2020, nor may he/she cover it from a security deposit provided by the tenant.

Many people are even more concerned with how they should pay their next electricity bill.\r\rEnergy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Green Party) and Wolfgang Urbantschitsch (Board Member of E-Control) explained why these concerns are unfounded. Even if there are payment difficulties, there will be no shutdowns on the part of the energy suppliers.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Until further notice, in any case until May 1st, \"no one in Austria will turn off electricity, gas or heat, \" the minister and the E-Control board assured. This applies to the population, but also to micro and small companies. Energy minister Ms Gewessler said it was a quick and unbureaucratic consensus in the industry. \"This is a good and important contribution,\" said the Green politician. However, this is not a legally fixed regulation.The energy suppliers would share the risk with the network operators, said the minister responsible for energy and the environment.According to Urbantschitsch, it is also possible to arrange a deferral of payments or an installment plan with the utilities, or at most a reduction of advance payments for companies, since there is a reduction in energy consumption for company closings.\r\rChamber of Labour AK for legal regulation\rThe major energy suppliers for electricity and gas have already announced that they will not switch off during the Corona crisis. The AK also expressly welcomes this voluntary principal. \"But all energy suppliers, including small and above all local and district heating suppliers, have to be brought on board,\" says Christa Schlager , head of the economic policy department at the AK. That seems to have succeeded with Thursday's agreement.\r\rAccording to E-Control, there were around 43,000 shutdowns in electricity and around 4,000 in gas in 2018. There are no official shutdown figures for the heating sector, but one thing is certain: In Austria around 140,000 people could not afford to keep their home sufficiently warm in 2018. This is also shown by a current study of heating types by the AK. Therefore, the AK is now calling for a legal shutdown ban for electricity, gas and heat during the duration of the Corona crisis.",

The lender's claims for repayment of capital or payment of interest due between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 2020 shall be deferred for a period of three months from the original due date.\r\r2. This deferral is subject to the condition that the respective borrower (consumer or microentrepreneur) has suffered a loss of income due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes it unreasonable for the borrower to continue his/her debt service.\r\r3. It is in particular unreasonable for the borrower to continue his/her debt service, if his or her reasonable maintenance or the reasonable maintenance of his or her dependants is at risk.\rThe provisions for deferring the due date of payments under consumer loans and loans to microenterprises largely follow those of German law.

However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.\r\rThis measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  \r\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists. According to the current tax rules adopted, the owners pay between HRK 150 and 1,500 (\u20ac 20 -200) per bed in annual taxes. The amount is determined by the Assembly of the municipality. If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (\u20ac100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. \r\rThe amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than 150,00 kn, nor more than 1.500,00 kn. If the representative body does not decide on the amount of the lump-sum tax (per bed /\raccommodation unit in the campsite / accommodation unit in the Robinson tourism facility), the lump-sum tax is set at 750.00 kn.representative body of the local self-government unit.\r\r\r",

This quick initiation was possible because the country had already prepared to start electronic prescriptions in a pilot project in two political districts in the regional province in Carinthia in April 2020. However, according to the Austrian Chamber of Doctors, this measure will be discontinued again after the crisis is over. The measure is targeted especially to those who need long-term medication.\r\rIn addition to the electronic prescription, further measures for the period of the CoV pandemic were introduced, including for instance the suspension of the authorization requirement (chief physician requirement) for many medications. Furthermore, ambulance transports are free of charge until further notice; the same applies to medical aids and aids up to a total of \u20ac1,500 as well as X-ray and cross-sectional examinations. Sickness reports to doctors are currently also possible by telephone. Doctors, psychotherapists and midwives can also invoice necessary telemedical treatments (via Skype, video conference or telephone) such as a service performed in the ordination.",

There, the patients can either pick up the medicine themselves or send someone.\rIn cases where e-medication is not working or is not yet working, doctors were also given the opportunity to send prescriptions to the pharmacies by fax or email. \rThe electronic prescription is primarily intended to help older people and people with previous illnesses to avoid medical practices as best they can given the spread of coronavirus in Austria. Accordingly, the measure is mainly intended for people with long-term medication.\rHowever, in principle, it is also possible that the doctor prescribes medication for acute cases. ",

To counteract this, a package of measures was first presented by the government on 19 March.

This would mean that the police can give those affected by domestic violence applications for an injunction against violent partners at first contact and take the completed forms with them on inspection visits a few days later. Applications can also be submitted electronically. The removal of violent offenders would also be guaranteed in quarantine areas. On 5 April, new measures where presented and figures showing a slight decrease in the number of domestic violence cases.",

He appealed to victims of domestic violence, mostly women and children, not to remain silent. Police officers would know exactly what to do in a specific case, they were \u2018trained to decide exactly that\u2019 - and also for prevention.\r\rSince the weekend, there has been extensive information and services on the subject of violence in the family on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, and additional advertisements since Sunday.

Due to travel bans, maintaining this care has become a major problem. But also those who are cared for by family members may encounter capacity problems, as well as those in older people's homes or care homes, when staff get sick or are in quarantine.\rThus, the government has announced to provide a specific Covid-Fund worth \u20ac100 million for the 460,000 persons in need of care, to be distributed among Austria's nine federal states (as nursing care lies within their competencies). It lies within the regional states' responsibility on how to invest this money.

At the same time, civilian servants who were currently working in federal institutions such as museums would be assigned to organisations in need of support, e.g. in the nursing area.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "On the 17 March, the Chancellor announced\u00a0a package of government-backed and guaranteed loans to support businesses, making available an initial GBP 330 billion of guarantees \u2013 equivalent to 15% of GDP. This was on top of a series of measures announced at Budget 2020 on the 12 March, where the government announced GBP 30 billion of additional support for public services, individuals and businesses experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.\u00a0 \r\rChanges to SSP were part of the initial Budget\u00a0package, subsequently extended on the 17 March, and accounted for in Sections 39 to 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 40 amends the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.\u00a0 Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the changes in SSP will be back-dated to 13th of March.\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In order to traditionally qualify for SSP (currently \u00a394.25 and payable by employers for a maximum of 28 weeks), there is a wait of three\u00a0days before an individual employee becomes eligible. However, under the new ruling,\u00a0SSP will be\u00a0paid from day 1, rather than day 4 of an individual's\u00a0absence from work if that person is\u00a0absent from work due to sickness or the\u00a0need to self-isolate caused by COVID-19. This applied retrospectively from\u00a0the 13th of\u00a0March.\u00a0\r\rMoreover, from\u00a0the 20th of March\u00a0onwards, those who have COVID-19 or who are advised to self-isolate will be able to obtain an \u201cisolation note\u201d by visiting the National Health Service (NHS) 111 online and completing an online form, rather than visiting a doctor. For COVID-19 cases, this replaces the usual need to provide a \u201cfit note\u201d after seven days of sickness absence. \r\rFor those not eligible for\u00a0SSP e.g. the\u00a0self-employed or those earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of GBP 118 per week, but who have\u00a0COVID-19 or are advised to self-isolate, the government says that they can\u00a0now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit (UC) or new style Employment and Support Allowance. \r\rFor those who are\u00a0self-employed and receiving Universal Credit with\u00a0COVID-19 or advised to self-isolate, the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed. This change took effect on 13 March and will last for the duration of the outbreak, to ensure that self-employed UC claimants will receive support.\r",

            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "The Chancellor is reported to have met\u00a0and worked with\u00a0trade unions and business groups, in order to support peoples' financial security.\u00a0There is evidence on Hansard (official record of proceedings in Parliament) that the\u00a0 Chancellor 'spoke to the trade unions'\u00a0on the 18th of March and on the 19th of March, he met with\u00a0the TUC, the CBI, the BCC and the FSB. This was done\u00a0with a view to urgently developing new forms of employment support to help protect people\u2019s jobs and incomes through this period (see https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2020-03-19/debates/8B1662BD-F065-4731-AA48-5BA21424C2D0/Covid-19EmploymentSupport). There are no explicit details of discussion.\r\rPreviously, the TUC had called for changes to the SSP system. On the 18th of March, the TUC stated that the\u00a0sick pay system is 'broken', stating that at a maximum of \u00a394.25 per week, Statutory sick pay (SSP) is not enough to live on.\u00a0The TUC further averred that the\u00a0average worker earns \u00a3512 per week, so for the estimated 7 million people who may come to rely on SSP, any time off work will constitute\u00a0'a large income shock.'\r\rThe TUC also pointed out that\u00a0many people aren\u2019t eligible for SSP, as approximately\u00a02 million people do not qualify for such payments\u00a0due to the fact that they do not\u00a0meet\u00a0the lower earnings limit of \u00a3118 per week. The TUC criticised the Chancellor for not\u00a0extending eligibility for sick pay to these lower earners; he instead pointed them\u00a0to\u00a0the benefit system. He has announced minor improvements to the way the benefit system operates, but the TUC is still critical that the system will fail to provide appropriate support, mainly due to the\u00a0five-week wait for first payment and the low level of benefits then provided\u00a0(Employment and Support Allowance is just \u00a373.10).\r\rThe TUC thus called on the\u00a0government to\u00a0remove the lower earnings limit for qualification for sick pay. It also urged the government to\u00a0immediately increase the weekly level of SSP (\u00a394.25) to at least the\u00a0equivalent of a week\u2019s pay at the Real Living Wage, as well as to end the\u00a0five-week wait for benefits\u00a0(see https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/coronavirus-help-what-workers-need-now).\r",

Major church-related organisations, NGO and private employers do not engage in collective bargaining; employers criticize the underfinancing of the statutory heath insurance.   \rAgainst this background the new sectoral agreement on a COVID-19 bonus for health care workers is a very new development. Some NGO founded the employer organisation BVAP for changing employment relations in the sector by engaging in collective bargaining. Wage negotiations with the United Services Union ver.di are ongoing since late 2019. Business organisations are highly critical of the new agreement saying that they do not see where the money shall come from. \r\rThe collective bargaining partners BVAP and ver.di wish for their agreements - this one as well as future ones - to be extended by the labour minister.",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Under this regulation, objective dismissals are prohibited. These dismissals have a severance pay of 20 days per year worked and a maximum of one year salary, when the judge finds these cases appropriate. Although, in the case of finding them inadmissible, the compensation rises to 33 days per year worked and a maximum of two annuities.\r\rThe legal wording indicates: 'Force majeure and the economic, technical, organizational and production causes covered by the measures for suspension of contracts and reduction of working hours provided for in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree Law 8/2020, of March 17 cannot be understood as justifications for the termination of the employment contract or dismissal.'\r\rThus, it follows from this text that more than prohibiting these dismissals, it makes them more expensive, because, if they occur, the judge will declare them inadmissible, and therefore the compensation will be greater than if they were due to objective causes.\r\r",

For this, the Executive has approved that, in the event that a company suspends its activity due to the health crisis, the temporary contracts that its workers have (including training, relief and interim contracts) are also suspended. After this crisis, the duration of these eventual contracts will be prolonged for the time they have been suspended.\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The suspension of temporary contracts, including training, relief and interim contracts, for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17, will mean the computation will be interrupted, both for the duration of these contracts, as well as the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period, in each of these contractual modalities, with respect to the workers affected by them.\r\rArticle 5 of RDL 9/2020 provides that the suspension of temporary contracts for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of RDL 8/2020, including training, relief and interim contracts, means the interruption of the computation of both the duration of such contracts as of the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period.\r\rThus, RDL 9/2020 does not indicate that the causes of force majeure, or the economic, technical, organizational or production related to the COVID-19 constitute an enabling budget so that the parties can proceed directly to the suspension of the temporary employment contracts. On the contrary, RDL 8/2020 refers to the suspensions of contracts decided by the company, after confirmation of the force majeure by the competent Labor Authority, or after processing the consultative and negotiating period. Therefore, the paralysis of the effects of the reciprocal obligations of the parties to the temporary contract requires that the causes concur and that the expressed procedural rules have been followed. It is for these assumptions and conditions that it is established that the suspension also has the additional, and exceptional, effect of interrupting the calculation of the term of life or duration of the temporary contract.\r\rThe norm refers to temporary contracts in general, although it is specified that formative, relief and interim contracts are included.\r\rThe interruption of the calculation means that the period of suspension of the contract does not count for the purposes of determining neither the agreed term of validity nor the maximum duration. Likewise, although the rule does not make it explicit, it seems logical to conclude that the suspension time does not count either for the purposes of computing the terms of thirty and twenty-four months that are foreseen in application of the limiting rule of the concatenation of temporary contracts in the assumptions of article 15.5 of the Workers Statute.",

In Spain, in 85% of housing leases, the owner is a natural person, a small owner. This particularity of the rental market in Spain makes it especially necessary that the measures adopted facilitate agreements between the parties to allow the payment of rents. For this reason, proposals are established in this area aimed at the necessary protection for the most vulnerable groups that may significantly affect their ability to cope with rent, while ensuring a balance between the parties that prevents the vulnerability of tenants from being shifted to lessors, especially those for whom rental income may be essential.",

This initiative is then aimed to improve, at the same time, population's access to disinfectants. \rIt provides changes regarding turnover of excise goods (strong alcohols).

In the light of the above, during the COVID-19 epidemic no financial excise duty is required to obtain a security certificate, for disinfectant manufacturers importing alcohol from another Member State. \r\rFurthermore, the State Revenue Service may grant a reduction of the general excise duty in the amount of up to 90 % to companies which have a special permit (licence) for the operation of an approved warehouse and which carries out production of alcohol. \r\rIn addition, the Ministry of Economy is elaborating a simplified procedure to admit into the market individual protection means against COVID-19 infection, encompassing disinfectants. The ones produced locally and recognized in the simplified procedure could be used only in Latvia, and they will not need to meet EU standard and EU mark.

They requested that opening hours should be limited to 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for the duration of the school closings for retail shops, as the measures would put many of the 400,000 domestic retail employees in a bind and demanded that the opening times in the shops .\r\rInitialy, the employers organisation (WK\u00d6) had rejected the union's demand for a temporary and significant reduction in working hours. 'The trade is fundamentally against any legal shortening of the opening times' said WK\u00d6 trade chairman Peter Buchm\u00fcller. The food trade in particular is an important infrastructure for maintaining the security of supply for the entire population and is 'well equipped'. \r\rDue to the recent measures by the federal government, the shopping behavior of Austrians has changed. Social partners notice that customers shop less often, but buy more. The customer frequency decreases at a later hour. \r\rTherefore, the commercial social partners have agreed to adjust the opening hours accordingly.

To protect employees, social partners recommend that retailers implement the following measures as quickly as possible:\r\r- Plexiglass panes (\"breath protection\") and spacers at all checkouts and counters.\r- Gloves and hand disinfectants for all employees and apprentices (as soon as available again)\r- Regular disinfection of checkout workplaces, break and lounge rooms and the toilet facilities due to shorter cleaning intervals\r- Floor markings at all checkouts and counters to ensure the distance between customers and an orderly process in the store.\r- No scanning of customer cards by employees\r- Orderly access to all shops\r- When there is a particularly high number of customers at peak times, retailers should ensure that not too many customers are admitted at the same time.\r- And to provide increased information of customers.\r",

A temporary increase in the NFC limit without a PIN to, for example, 50 euros would significantly reduce the risk of infection both for the 110,000 employees in the food trade and for consumers. The employers regards only the restriction of the opening times as being ambivalent with regard to the tense labor market, but understands if it relieves the existing staff of the grocer.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Given existing staff shortages in the National Health Service after a decade of austerity and cuts, combined with the then impending scale of the coronavirus epidemic and predictions that many frontline health workers would themselves be taken ill and be away from work, the Government exhorted health care workers, retired in the past three years, to return to work in the health service.\r\rThe Coronavirus Act 2020 contains provisions for the emergency registration of health professionals, social workers and also covers emergency volunteers (leave and compensation). \r\rThe Government states that the Act will allow an increase in the numbers of available health and social care workforce and reduce the number of admin tasks they have to perform so they have more time to spend with patients.\r\rTo support this, the Act will:\r\r\u2022enable regulators to emergency register suitable people as regulated healthcare professionals, such as nurses, midwives or paramedics. This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic\r\r\r\u2022enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults\r\r\r\u2022enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks\u2019 statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health\r\r\r\u2022provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements\r\r\r\u2022suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.\r\r\r",

Those officers nearing thirty years' pensionable service have also been asked to delay retirement. The request came as\u00a0one in five police officers were off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus.\u00a0 The Met, which is Britain\u2019s biggest force, is already understood to be experiencing absentee rates of 20%. This already high figure came\u00a0before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.\r\rFinally, the Government and NHS England called\u00a0for a 'volunteer army' to help the vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. Over 750,000 people in just four days signed up the NHS's call for volunteers, three times the original target. On the 7th of April, the Royal Voluntary Service, the charity delivering the volunteer effort,\u00a0completed checks for the three quarters of a million applications and from the 8th, the NHS Volunteer Responders will support 2.5 million at risk people.\u00a0Their duties will include:\u00a0delivering medicines from pharmacies;\u00a0 driving patients to appointments; bringing them home from hospital; \u2022making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home; and transporting medical supplies and equipment for the NHS.\r\rThousands of these approved volunteers will be offered tasks from the 8th\u00a0via the GoodSAM app and will start helping people safely, with more expected to get requests over the coming weeks as referrals ramp up.\r\rHealth professionals, pharmacists and local authorities can upload requests for help on the NHS Volunteer Responders referrer\u2019s portal and volunteers pick the job they want to do that day and close the task once complete.\u00a0 Volunteers show themselves as available when their app is switched to \u2018on duty\u2019.\r\r",

This product offers improved conditions during the crisis.\r\rThe second initiative, which will extend EKF's existing reinsurance scheme to OECD countries, is intended to ensure that the Coronavirus Crisis does not deter private trade credit insurance companies from underwriting Danish exporters' export orders, as was the case during the financial crisis.",

In addition to artists, cultural mediators can now apply for this grant. The amount paid out by the KSVF corresponds to that of the hardship fund. A total of a maximum of \u20ac6,000 will be paid out - in the first phase up to \u20ac1,000 euros, in the second phase up to \u20ac2,000 euros per month for a maximum of three months.\r\rA separate service page has been set up for loss of income due to the Corona measures: KSVF service fund.\r\rIndividual funds run by copyright collecting societies (e.g. music, visual arts, film-making, etc.). Seven dedicated funds are also listed on the webpage.\r\rIn addition to the state instruments for compensating artists' loss of income, there is now also a private initiative. To help artists in the current crisis, foundations have joined together to form the \"Foundations Help Artists\" initiative and are supported by well-known people.\r\rWork grants from the City of Vienna due to COVID-19: Since the end of March, freelance artists and freelance scientists with their main residence in Vienna have been able to apply for one-time work grants of up to \u20ac3,000. In this crisis situation, there should be the opportunity to continue to pursue artistic and scientific activities (project development, reading, exhibition and lecture preparation and the like).",

The Microcredit Fund tool is aimed at small companies - the so-called micro-enterprises, as well as companies that have just started their business (to have up to three years of business history at the moment, with possible expansion - up to five years).\r\rThe idea is to enable banks to support this vulnerable group of start-ups that may have started a small family business with loans up to BGN 50,000 (\u20ac25,000). This will support their investment plans for the crisis and working capital so that they can continue their operations.\r\rThis tool is aimed at a target group of recipients who generally do not have easy access or have no access to bank financing at all - companies with no credit history.",

This measure follows the German example of Kurzarbeit, but is on a much smaller scale with a lot of narrowing criteria the applicant must fulfill. The support can be extended from 1 May 2020 for 3 months. The amount of the income support will be transferred directly from the state to the employee while the reduced wage will be paid by the employer.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Businesses who are shedding 30-50% of working time of employees compared with their pre-covid situation who can prove that their orders have not fallen by more than 50% and are working towards the \u201cinterests of the national economy\u201d are eligible. For every employee that is considered for layoff the state agrees to pay 70% of the part of the salary that was lost due to the worktime reduction. Only the part of salaries up to HUF 214,300 net (twice the minimum wage - \u20ac612 as of 15 Apr) per month receive the income supplement, earnings after that threshold are not subsidised. \r\rThe government calculates that on average a monthly HUF 64,500 per employee will be paid out, so the total cost for 3 months could be HUF 193.6bn (according to government calculations) or HUF 128bn according to our (KOPINT-T\u00e1rki Institute) calculations. \rAdditional criteria for eligibility-the employer must agree to keep headcount level until the end of the year in order to be considered for the subsidy\r\r-the shortened work contract may not drop below 4 hours per day of working time \r-employers must organise a training for the employee in 30% of the hours that have been cut \r\rfrom working time and pay wages for this time as well \rApplications open on 16 April, 2020",

Applications must be filed to the public employment services and will be reviewed. It is not known how many will apply, as the employer has alternatives: if fired, employees get unemployment benefits for three months, they can be sent home on unpaid leave, or citing the covid situation as a vis maior they get no wages for down-time. Critics also argue that the measure comes much too late, 5 weeks after Hungary announced a state of emergency on 11 March 2020.\r",
            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "The Hungarian employers' federation MGYOSZ, the National Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers (VOSZ) and the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MKIK) welcomed the measure and said most of their proposals had been heard. They were consulted before the measures were announced. The trade union confederation LIGA said the government should do more as it does not help the thousands who had already been laid off. Trade union VDSZ said the measure did not offer job protection. Trade unions were informed at the tripartite VKF which meets weekly since the start of the crisis.",

For this reason, it is necessary to implement a series of measures whose primary objective is to sustain economic activity in the face of the transitory difficulties that are occurring in Spain as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.\r\rThis measure is aimed at supporting a policy for industrialization, with the aim of continuing to provide liquidity to companies to develop their projects.\r\rFor this reason, it is established that for a period of two and a half years, extendable by Agreement of the Council of Ministers, the loans granted by the General Secretariat for Industry and SMEs may be refinanced. For the projects currently in execution, the criteria for evaluating the execution of the projects are relaxed, always guaranteeing the fulfillment of the project objectives.",

It is considered as a requirement for the employer the need to ensure, at all times, the availability of appropriate means of prevention against COVID-19.\r\rThe remuneration received for the work activity performed, under the extraordinary measures to make employment more flexible, will be compatible with different unemployment benefits.",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The decree states that taxpayers (SMEs and self-employed) with a turnover of up to \u20ac600,000 will have until May 20 to file the tax returns for the month of April. In other words, they may postpone the filing of the quarterly VAT declaration, the fractional payment of corporation tax, as well as the personal income tax. In the case of domiciled declarations, the term is also extended by one month and goes from April 15 to May 15. Regardless of the time of submission, all charges will be made on May 20. That also includes statements filed before the 15th of this month.\r\rIn this way, the Government shows its commitment to SMEs and the self-employed, who make up the bulk of the productive fabric of Spain. In fact, the measure approved today will benefit 3.4 million taxpayers, who represent 95% of companies and freelancers who must file their tax return in April. In practice, this moratorium represents liquidity of 3,558 million for SMEs and the self-employed.\r\rIn addition, this measure aims to give tax managers and advisors a greater margin to collect the information necessary to comply with the tax obligations of their clients at a time of great difficulty due to the effects of the health emergency.\r\rThis decision is part of the strategy of the Ministry of Finance to combat the effects of COVID-19 on the activity of self-employed and SMEs. In fact, the Government has already approved the possibility that both groups could postpone the payment of taxes to a maximum of \u20ac30,000 for six months, with three months without interest. This measure, with a maximum impact of 14,000 million, could benefit 99.8% of the self-employed and 94% of SMEs, which are those who are below this level of turnover.",

The Act (abbreviated as the \u201cSpecial Act\u201d) is a follow-up to the initial ad-hoc regulation introduced in early March. \r\rUstawa z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczeg\u00f3lnych rozwi\u0105zaniach zwi\u0105zanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdzia\u0142aniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chor\u00f3b zaka\u017anych oraz wywo\u0142anych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw.",

The aid is available for self-employed and freelancers (holders of contracts for performing specific tasks or umowa o dzie\u0142o, in Polish). The aid is on request, there are some limitations (those whose monthly revenue in the preceding month exceeded the average pay multiplied by three are not eligible for the aid).\r\rSelf-employed and freelancers may request the public aid to cover their income lost as a result of halting operations in the amount of 80% of the national minimum wage. In case of freelancers with the reported income below 50% minimum wage, they can request the amount of all their income.  Self-employed paying taxes on the basis of a tax card (simplified form of a corporate income tax) may claim an allowance in a lump sum of PLN 1,300 (\u20ac290). In all cases the allowance has a form of a one-time payment. In all cases the aid is not available to those whose monthly revenue in the preceding month exceeded the average pay multiplied by three.  \r",

Also, the circulars of the Ministry of Interior no 108/oik.7874/2020 and 109/\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba.8000 provide 'Special purpose leave' for the employees in the public sector.",

The employer is obliged to grant it. The leave applies to employees of the public and private sector. According to the law, the minimum duration of the leave is 4 days, of which 3 days are special purpose and 1 day of regular leave. The regular leave days are deducted from the annual leave. The leave may be used exclusively by one parent or alternatively by both. During the special purpose leave the employee\u2019s salary and social security contributions are paid regularly. 2/3 of the expense are paid by the state and one third by the employer. \r\rThe use of the special purpose leave is not allowed in case of suspension of the operations of the enterprise due to the extraordinary measures. After the decision to extend the closure of schools until 10 May, newer arrangements (decisions of the Ministry of Labour and Interior) provide for the extension of the special purpose leave for working parents until 10 May in both the public and private sectors.\r\r",

The Hardship Fund will\u00a0provide council tax relief to help those affected most by coronavirus. The funding will go to local authorities in England to enable them to reduce the 2020 to 2021 council tax bills of working age people receiving Local Council Tax Support. Councils will also be able to use the funding to provide further discretionary support to vulnerable people through other support arrangements such as Local Welfare Schemes.\r\rGuidance for the GBP 500 million Hardship Fund was\u00a0released on the 24th of March,\u00a0aimed at providing clarity to\u00a0local authorities\u00a0on how to allocate the funding following its announcement at Budget.\r\rThis amends s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.\r\r",

It says that councils will already have established their local council tax support schemes for 2020-21 and that\u00a0the Government therefore expects that billing authorities will primarily use their grant allocation to reduce the council tax liability of individuals in their area, using their discretionary powers under s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. \r\rFurther, it states that councils may also want to use some funding to deliver increased financial assistance through other local support mechanisms, having considered local circumstances.\rThe Government states that councils should expedite provision of support to individuals in their area, using existing policies and schemes to deliver assistance where practical. Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority.\r\rIt also states that council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites.\r\rThe Government confirms that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support.\u00a0 Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms.",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Under Section 3 of government decree 47/2020, the sectors selected as one most affected by the COVID-19 crisis will receive protection from rent increase or rental contract termination. The measure applies to sectors where businesses typically rent rather than own their premises and where the economic impacts of covid-19 have caused financial strains. Although the measure does not specificy if rental contracts are banned from termination even if no rent is paid by the tenant at all, experts agree that with the eviction ban in place, tenants are likely to get away with not paying at all during the 'state of emergency' period while their business is likely to be closed down.",

The rule overrides any rent increases stipulated in the rental contract. Legal experts say that if tenants do not pay rent at all, landlords are likely to seek agreement on special terms rather than lose clients on a shrinking property rental market. Analysts argue that the effectiveness of this measure in supporting businesses is very low, since under the current circumstances property owners were not likely to raise rents anyway, if anything, rents are dropping on current market conditions.",

Furthermore, all exhibitions are closed. This means that numerous artists do not have any income due to statutes and rule made as a result of the spread of corona virus. Thus, the Minister of Culture and the Parliament have decided to introduce a support scheme for artists. The scheme is in force from 9 March 2020 until 9 June 2020\r\rLegal reference: BKG 2020-04-01 nr 332. \r",

The support scheme aim to support both income/tax types due to the variation of both in the working year of the artists. The support is an extension of the support to self-employed and freelancers with B-income, based in law : BKG 2020-04-01 nr 332 \u2013 Compensations scheme for self-employed in economic crisis as a result of COVID-19.\r\rArtists that have an aggregate A- and B-income and a taxable income from artistic performance between DKK 100,000 and 800,000 a year can apply for the support scheme. The Ministry of Culture will cover 75% of the expected loss of income.\rAccording to scheme, artists can for example, seek compensation for: \rLoss of income based on professional artistic work can be in the form of:\r-\tFailure to sell works, books, etc.\r-\tCancelled concerts, performances and performances, etc.\r-\tCancelled workshops, teaching and lectures, etc.\r-\tOther lost income based on professional artistic work as a direct consequence of COVID-19. \r",

On the other hand, the employer organisations, in particular Danish Chamber of Commerce, and the unions in commerce and trade - HK/Danmark - have\u00a0pointed out\u00a0that the original support legislation\u00a0regarding self-employed and freelancers only includes\u00a0work that falls under B-income tax.\u00a0Consequently, they want the\u00a0provision extended to encompass both A- and B-income for all self-employed and freelancers.",

Other health personnel will receive a \u20ac500 bonus, he added, specifying that these bonuses will be free of charges and taxes. All of the hospital staff will also receive a 50% increase in overtime, i.e. an average of more than \u20ac600 per employee, also without taxes or charges, according to the Minister of Health, Olivier V\u00e9ran. Each member of staff will therefore receive an average of \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac2,000, he said, with a total cost to the State of \u20ac1.3 billion. In addition to this, there will be a future bonus for staff in the medico-social sector, in particular those in home for the elderly and dependent persons (EHPAD), which have had to reorganise. To launch this bonus, the government has to discuss with local authorities, particularly with the departments that often finance them, to determine the conditions for financing this bonus",

When the measure started Aldi was in need of 3,000 addtional workers whereas Mc Donalds' franchise companies employed 60,000 workers at risk of unemployment. As explained by McDonald's HR manager, the comapny aimed at a very fast solution and and therefore focussed on the individual transfer to another company. \rMcDonalds is affiliated to the federal association of system caterers BdS which negotiated a sectoral Corona-protection agreement with trade union NGG (see factsheet) which states that dismissals shall be avoided. \r\rAldI's staff needs are communicated to regional McDonald's companies (franchises) which offer leaves for workers who want to take up these fixed-term jobs  During the leave, wages are paid by ALDI.",

In order to realize this purpose, the Ministry proposes that income from voluntary work in public health services or with private persons who, according to law or agreement, offer health services to the population, should not, however, result in a reduction or loss of pension. To prevent pension reduction for health professionals taking on extra work during the crisis connected to covid 19, amendments to three pension scheme regulations were passed. The measure cover health and social standby and service, and the regulations comprise The Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund, pension fund for nurses and pension fund for employees in farmacies.

The new agreement came on top of a sectoral arrangement concluded by the union NGG and the employers' organisation BdS (covering 120,000 workers), agreed in early March which stipluates a wage rise up to \u20ac 12 per hour until 2021. \r",

The measure treats all industries equally, but will especially benefit the most vulnerable companies. The measure covers only limited liability companies, etc. which has gone from surplus in 2018 or 2019, to a deficit in 2020. The delimitation ensures that the companies that benefit from the measure are also suitable to make a profit. Thus, it is avoided that companies that are not fit to make a profit, or who do not initially do business, benefit from the measure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Companies will have a temporary opportunity to return up to NOK 30 million of corporate deficits in 2020 against taxed profits the previous two years. The tax value of losses in 2020 will be paid to the companies at the tax settlement in 2021. One advantage of the measure is that the extent of payments to the companies depends directly on the severity of the situation. In this way, the measure reinforces the tax system's stabilizing role and ability to curb the decline. The Government proposes that an amount limit of NOK 30 million will be set for the amount of deficit in 2020 that can be reversed against previous profits. The relatively high amount of money means that most profitable small and medium-sized companies with a deficit in 2020 can take full advantage of the scheme. The amount limit is necessary to have some control over how large a loss of proceeds the scheme may entail. With a limit of NOK 30 million for deficit, the measure is estimated to reduce accrued tax revenue from corporate tax in 2020 by the order of NOK 3.5 billion.",

The measure is expected to have little impact on the volume of flights. However, the measure is intended as a temporary relief for the airlines during the outbreak of the coronavirus. The purpose of the tax is primarily to provide the state with revenue, but the tax can have an environmental impact by reducing the demand for flights. The Ministry points out that tourism in general and aviation in particular are severely affected by the virus outbreak. Maintaining a fiscal charge on air travel can help exacerbate the negative financial consequences of the virus outbreak.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The duty to pay air passenger tax is incurred when the flight starts from a Norwegian airport, and the fee is calculated per passenger who commences taxable flight from a Norwegian airport. The cancellation of the tax in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2020 means that the tax will be abolished both for flights made earlier this year and for flights commenced in the period up to and including 31 October 2020. The time of purchase of the air ticket is of no significance for the duty to pay. Flights starting on or after 1 November 2020 will be subject to tax. It follows from the proposal that the fee paid for flights earlier this year should be repaid to the airlines. ",

Many businesses are required to shut down, and the ripple effects of measures to limit infection are significant. This has resulted in a very high number of layoffs in a number of industries. The amendment to the lay-off regulation reduce the cost for employers and increase the unemployment benefit for the unemployed. Part time lay-off can be applied if the employee work 40 per cent or less (changed from 50 per cent).",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The lay-off regulations secure unemployment benefits to the individual employee if he or she is laid off. In this way, companies can quickly reduce their costs, while at the same time the working relationship can continue. The period where employers have to pay wages during lay-offs (the employer's period) is reduced from 15 to 2 days. The state carry the cost from day 3. The unemployment benefit starts when the unemployed person has been unemployed and has been registered as a real job seeker for at least three of the last fifteen days. These three days constitute the waiting period in the unemployment benefit scheme. To reduce the burden on workers the waiting time is removed for the laid off. The temporarily dismissed are guaranteed 100 per cent salary up to 6G (aprox. EUR 50700) from day 3, when employer is exempted from paying wage, through day 20. Unemployment benefits for laid-off persons and those who become ordinary unemployed are adjusted upwards and shall constitute 80 per cent of the former wage (dagpengegrunnlaget) up to 3G (aprox. EUR 25350) and 62.4 per cent of the part of former wage that is between 3G and 6G (aprox. EUR 50700). The lower income limit for entitlement to unemployment benefit is lowered to 0.75G (aprox. EUR 6340) over the past 12 months or 2.25G over the past 36 months.

In addition, companies have the opportunity to compensate for wage losses through \"VEU/SVU-allowance\". In addition, there are opportunities to obtain grants from other sources, such as any competency funds, etc.\r\rThe model was first launched in the service, tourism, hotel and restoration industries, and then the construction and offshore industries were added. At the same time, several other industries are on their way to be included in the model.",

For example, it may be competencies targeted to sales and service within the restaurant industry.\r\rCompanies receive up to 100 percent of their wage costs, while employees participate in distance education.

The measure was designed to make working arrangements more flexible for the employer to help protect jobs in companies where business has shut down or work reduced due to the pandemic.",

The Labour Code (modified in late 2018) earlier allowed the working time banking frame to be raised to 36 months only by collective agreement. Now employers can use this method of working time arrangement for up to 24 months without signing/modifying a collective agreement. This means that an employer who is unable to give work to the employee during the pandemic period will continue to pay full wages, but can order extended working hours to make up for the loss when business returns to normal.",

In today's situation, they will probably be dismissed because the employer is unable to take them back into regular work. The opportunity to get a new job is small, so they will have to reapply for unemployment benefits as ordinary unemployed.

The regulation (FOR-2020-04-08-735) takes effect immediately and the payments will be disbursed as soon as NAV gets a technical solution in place for the scheme.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A compensation scheme for self-employed persons and freelancers who have lost all, or part of their income was approved by the government on 8 April. The new temporary scheme covers up to 80 per cent of income, limited up to an annual income of 6G (approx. EUR 50700) (1G = the basic amount in the national insurance), and applies to income that does not entitle to unemployment benefit. The scheme includes those who have lost income on or after March 16. The compensation is given from day 17 after the loss of income. One must apply in arrears for the loss of income the month before, so that The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration will know about any income for the month in which the application applies. Generally, the basis for compensation for freelancers is calculated on the basis of an average of the income reported to the Tax Administration via the current \u201ca-scheme\u201d in the last 12 months before March 2020. A shorter period can be used for newly established freelancers. Generally, the basis for compensation to self-employed persons is calculated on the basis of business income over the past three income years. The application is due in early May. The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration is already in the process of creating a digital solution that allows payments to be made automatically. The application is due in early May. Those applying for the new scheme will receive detailed guidance along the way in the application process.",

In an ordinary situation, the employer must pay sick pay for a period of up to 16 calendar days (the employer period). In its decision 390, 16 March 2020, the Storting asked the government to reduce the employer period for the payment of sick pay to employees from 16 to three days for sick leave related Covid-19. The exemption provision is stipulated in the temporary regulations on exemptions from the National Insurance Act and the Working Environment Act in connection with the corona pandemic, and expires on 31 December 2020 or when the Ministry / King decides. The exemption provision means that the National Insurance Scheme reimburses employers' expenses for sick leave for coronavirus-related absences from day four to day 16. The employer offsets sick pay and may claim reimbursement from the Labor and Welfare Agency for the number of days exceeding three. The temporary reduction in employer funding responsibility for sick pay for employees related to the coronavirus is estimated on an uncertain basis to result in increased sick pay payments of NOK 4 700 million in 2020.",

The guarantee scheme will be organized through the Guarantee Institute for Export Credit (GIEK). The state contributes 90 percent of the guarantee provided that external banks, credit institutions or other commercial counterparties provide the remaining 10 percent. To take part in the scheme it is required that the company is solvent. For companies that did not have an equity ratio of at least 8 percent at the end of the last quarterly report prior to the corona crisis, financial creditors must waive interest and defer repayment for 3 months to gain access to the guarantees. SAS and Wider\u00f8e satisfy the equity requirement. For Norwegian, an immediate facility of NOK 300 million will be made available. When and if the company achieves a reduction in interest and repayments from creditors, an additional NOK 1.2 billion will be made available. The last NOK 1.5 billion will be made available when the company has improved its solvency to a satisfactory level. If the state is to provide guarantees to Norwegian, both owners and lenders must contribute to a better financial situation for the company.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The government proposes to restore the Government bond fund with a limit of up to NOK 50 billion. The largest Norwegian companies largely borrow money in the credit bond market. In the near future, many of these companies will need to secure financing in this market. However, the bond market's ability to provide credit has diminished substantially in recent weeks. Liquidity is low and risk premiums are high. Previous experience has shown that the Government bond fund can contribute to a more efficient market for credit bonds. This will make it easier for the big companies to get the liquidity they need in the difficult situation created by Covid-19.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Government Bond Fund shall be used for the purchase of bonds in the market. It is established with an investment limit of up to NOK 50 billion. The presence of the fund is intended to encourage other investors to participate in the bond market as well. The Government Bond Fund\u2019s Investments in new credit bond loans will be made in cooperation with other investors and on market terms. Within a mandate set by the Ministry of Finance, the National Insurance Scheme Fund (Folketrygdfondet) will decide on which bond loans to invest in. The mandate of the Fund instructs management to seek to achieve the highest possible return on costs over time and at the same time contribute to increased liquidity and capital access to the credit bond market in Norway, within the framework that applies as for the management of the Fund. The return is measured in Norwegian kroner. In its exercise as creditor, the management of the fund shall have as its overriding objective to protect the financial interests of the fund.",

The goal is to help the business sector avoid bankruptcies and recover quickly after the crisis is over. The scheme is temporary and will apply for the months of March, April and May. The government has set up a dedicated site where the companies can apply for grant to cover fixed and unavoidable costs. It is meant to be both easy to use and manage, and designed to give quickly imbursement. The scheme was designed by the government in close collaboration with The Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO), The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), Enterprise Federation of Norway (Virke), SMB Norway, Norwegian Employers Association for the Financial Sector (FA) and the Tax Administration. The EFTA Surveillance Authority ESA has approved the scheme. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Business Compensation Scheme will comprise companies with at least 30 per cent drop in sales compared to the same month the year before. For March, the rate will be 20 per cent, since the strict anti-infection measures were first introduced on March 12. The scheme will initially apply to March, April and May, and payments will be made in arrears based on actual sales in the months in question. A two-part model is used for calculating compensation. 1) Companies instructed by the state to shut down to prevent spread of Covid-19 virus will be able to apply for compensation of up to 90 per cent of their unavoidable fixed costs in the specified months, calculated as follows: reduction in turnover x unavoidable fixed costs x 90 percent adjustment factor. 2) Firms that are not required to shut down, but still experiencing a reduction in turnover of 30 percent or more (20 percent in March), will have to pay an excess. Compensation is calculated as follows: reduction in sales x (unavoidable fixed costs - excess of NOK 10,000/approximately EUR 890) x 80 percent adjustment factor. The minimum limit for compensation is NOK 5,000. If the support per enterprise exceeds NOK 30 million per month, the excess will be bisect.",

These new rules allow for the coverage of: employees with an annual working time account (forfaits jours) in days or hours - i.e. employees whose working hours cannot be fixed in advance (often managers); civil aviation crews, freelance journalists (who are paid for each article ordered); salespeople with the status of sales representatives (VRP); home-based employees paid on a piecework basis; intermittent entertainment workers and models.

This decree is applicable to short-time compensation claims submitted from 12 Marc 2020 to 31 December 2020.

The number of hours taken into account is determined by converting a number of days or half-days into hours according to the following flat-rate periods:\r- a half-day not worked corresponds to 3.5 hours not worked;\r- a day not worked corresponds to 7 hours not worked;\r- a week not worked corresponds to 35 hours not worked.\rDays of paid leave and rest taken during the period of suspension or reduction of activity, as well as public holidays not worked which correspond to working days, are converted into hours according to the same procedures.\r\r2/ Civil aviation flight crew\rIn the case of civil aviation flight crews, whose working hours are organised in the form of alternating days of activity and days of inactivity, the number of hours giving rise to the payment of the allowance and the partial activity allowance shall be determined on the basis of a number of eligible days of inactivity. The latter is determined by taking into account the difference between the number of days of inactivity recorded and the number of days of inactivity normally guaranteed to the employee over the period in question. The number of days of inactivity obtained is converted into hours according to the following rule: each day of inactivity in excess of the number of days of inactivity guaranteed corresponds to 8.75 hours off work, within the limit of the legal weekly duration (35 hours) over the period in question.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "This publication is the epilogue of a two-week arm wrestling exchange between the Ministry of Labour and construction employers' organizations. Their members have indeed been accused of 'defeatism\" by the Minister of Labour for having chosen to stop almost all the building sites and ask for the partial unemployment of their employees. As of 1 April, 61,000 companies, including all the major players in the sector, representing 565,000 employees (i.e. 50% of the profession) had applied for this, according to the DARES.\rTo break the deadlock, the profession has therefore drawn up, under the aegis of the OPPBTP, its professional prevention body managed on an equal footing, this guide which is supposed to 'provide the conditions for employees to continue working in safety'.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Having received the approval of all the ministries concerned, the guide defines the protocols to be respected with the approval of clients and within the framework of social dialogue, the conditions of use of individual protection, respect for barrier gestures, and the procedures to be followed in the event of travel, for example.\rThese measures are capable of \"enabling a gradual resumption of activity\", as all the employers' federations have stressed. \"It also responds to the specific characteristics of certain worksites, such as those taking place in private homes\", says Patrick Li\u00e9bus, President of Capeb. In return, companies retain the right to suspend their activity, without running the risk of being refused access to partial activity.\r\"Particular attention is paid to the most vulnerable employees,\" the federations state, urging them \"not to involve apprentices, trainees and work-study students on building sites.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "About 1,300,000 employees work in the construction sector.",
            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "This guide received the agreement of the following employers and trade unions organisations representative of the Construction and Public Works sector:\r\rConf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des artisans et petites entreprises du b\u00e2timent, (Confederation of craftsmen and small construction companies)\rF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale du B\u00e2timent, (National Building Federation)\rF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Travaux Publics, (National Federation of Public Works)\rF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des salari\u00e9s de la Construction et du Bois (National Federation of Construction and Woodworkers)\rCFDT \r\r\rAlso it received the agreement of the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry for the Ecological and inclusive transition, the Ministry of Solidarity and Health.  \r\rSocial partners were consulted in the framework of the bipartite institution OPPBTP. If employers organisation reached a consensus on the handbook, trade unions have not agreed the document apart the CFDT (2nd trade union in the building industry, 3rd in the public works sector). All the building trade unions (CGT, 1st building trade union, FO, 3rd, CFTC, 4th, and CFE-CGC, 5th) said, in a joint press release of 3 April, that they were opposed to the resumption of construction sites, pointing out a risk to the health of employees, whereas the government had validated this guide. This one, for the drafting of which 'the trade unions were called upon when everything was already folded', 'will set aside health and lives in danger!', denounces the trade unions. 'The aim of this document is indeed to get the activity restarted by legally protecting the employers, by using formulas such as 'it is recommended', 'as far as possible', or by casting doubt on who is responsible for the obligations 'such as that of regularly cleaning common surfaces and installations'. 'We would have liked this guide to allow for business continuity for emergency work and to have another one edited for post-confinement. We were not heard,' the four unions regretted, calling on employees to 'use their right to withdraw...if they feel they are in danger'.",

The agreement covers the following issues: telework, full time arranged activity, short-time work, \"fourteen\" and work stoppage. All the measures will apply for the period from 16 March to 30 April 2020, 'possibly with retroactive effect for this period, depending on the situations already in place'.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The main subjects addressed by the agreement are:\r\r1. **Use of teleworking**\rOn a temporary basis and depending on the activity and the technological possibilities available, Daher has set up teleworking \"for a maximum number of group employees whenever possible\". It is up to the manager to regularly assess the workload and the ability of each individual to telework. The manager regularly informs the employee of his or her continued teleworking, or of the possibility of returning to the site \"for service requirements that cannot be carried out remotely\", or of being partially teleworking.\r\r2. **Adaptation of work organisation**\rIn some sectors of the company, the work organisation had to be adapted in order to comply with the instructions for taking up work at the post (cleaning, extended or moved lunch break, etc.). In the context of this \"adjusted full-time activity\", the company undertakes, despite a potential reduction in working hours, to maintain employee remuneration, including team bonuses, basket bonuses, meal vouchers or equivalent meal allowance in the absence of closed collective catering, etc. Moreover, \"as a completely exceptional measure and to take into account the commitment of the employees\", the hours not worked due to these adjusted schedules will not give rise to any recuperation.\r\r3. **Organisation of short-time working**\r\"In accordance with government directives known to date\", \"alternative systems\" to be used before the implementation of the partial activity system are identified in each company. As part of the agreement, and \"subject to the approval of the administration\", the equivalent of a seven-hour day taken as \"time bank/flexible/ reduced working hours (RTT)\" for non-management employees. For managers, one day of RTT (two for metalworking managers) is taken on a mandatory basis. In addition, the agreement continues, the setting of five working days of paid leave over the period of the agreement is imposed.\r\r4. **Remuneration during short-time working**\rIn an approach aimed at preserving purchasing power, Daher raises the remuneration of employees on short-time working to 95% of their net salary, \"instead of the 84% of net salary provided for by law\". In return for this matching contribution and in solidarity with employees whose activity will have been maintained, employees in partial employment will, before December 31, 2020, and as soon as the confinement period has ended, perform up to 25 hours of activity for non-managers and three days for managers, for each full month of partial unemployment. \r\r5. **The \"fourteen-week\" period**\rIn the event that, for safety or health reasons, the employee is sent home at the initiative of the employer or at the request of the client, it is up to the company to find a solution to temporarily offer him/her another assignment or to transfer him/her to another status.\rFor the employee who wishes to take up an assignment at his own initiative \"in a fortnight\" and whose situation is not recognised by the health insurance fund, the company \"shows adaptation and kindness\" to enable him to use as far as possible any other more advantageous arrangement in terms of maintaining remuneration (paid leave, RTT, time bank, flexible, etc.).\r\r6. **Work stoppage**\rIn the event of a work stoppage (illness, childcare, population at risk at COVID-19, maternity, etc.), the employee benefits from the compensation scheme provided for, via the daily social security benefits and the employer's supplement set according to the Daher Group.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Following the announcement by the President of the Republic on 16 March 2020 to 'reduce contacts and travel to the strict minimum throughout the country' to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic, the management of STMicroelectronics and the CFDT and CFE-CGC unions reached an agreement on 18 March 2020 \"on the adaptation of the organisation of manufacturing services\". The objective of the social partners is to 'preserve the protection of the health and safety of the employees present while maintaining the company's operations as much as possible'.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The temporary adjustment applies, from 19 March to 2 April, to employees working in the 'Manufacturing Front-End and Back-End' and support departments at the Crolles (Is\u00e8re), Grenoble (Is\u00e8re), Rennes (Ille-et-Vilaine), Rousset (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) and Tours (Indre-et-Loire) plants.\rIn order to guarantee 'these essential activities related to the safety of the installations and the quality of the products and services', the teams are reduced. The agreement provides that they may be reduced by up to 50% of the theoretical workforce, with a minimum of 2 employees per sector. Over the period, the management must draw up a provisional schedule for the composition of the teams, ensuring that there are rotations between employees. In the event of an unforeseen additional absence, one or more employees may be called in to complete the team. In any event, the provisional schedule is adapted on a daily basis to take into account any changes in the situation.\rThe employees affected by this reduction in activity shall not suffer any loss of remuneration and shall be paid at the normal time, 'as if they had worked full time according to their usual working hours'. In other words, the agreement specifies that the rest days imposed on certain employees will be considered as actual working time for the calculation of remuneration elements.\r\rIn addition, to limit physical contact, the agreement provides that employees travelling to the sites may travel with their personal vehicle. These trips are financed by the company in the form of mileage allowance payments on the June 2020 payroll at the latest.  All STMicroelectronics employees other than Manufacturing and Production Support who travel to their place of work at the request of their management are also eligible for this measure.\r\rFinally, a systematic temperature reading can be taken at the entrance to the sites. In the event that the temperature exceeds a limit set by the central health, safety and working conditions commission (CSSCT) and the occupational physician coordinating France, employees are invited to go home and consult their treating physician or log on to the health insurance website to obtain a work stoppage.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The agreement applies to production workers of STMicroelectronics which employs about 10,100 people in France. In the group, about 67% of the employees are working in production. About 5,000 to 6,000 employees may be covered by this agreement (estimation).",

On 3 April 2020, they concluded a branch agreement designed to facilitate the taking of paid holidays in order to 'face the difficulties inherent in this period and to prepare as well as possible for a resumption of activity'. The metallurgy agreement on work organisation to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic was signed by the UIMM and the CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO trade union federations.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The agreement stresses, in its preamble, that the COVID-19 epidemic and the measures taken by the public authorities to limit its spread have serious consequences for metalworking companies. But it also underlines the right of everyone to preserve their health and to work safely. Faced with contradictory demands, the signatories call for an appropriate social dialogue in companies. They add that they would like company negotiations to be favoured so that the branch agreement plays exclusively its supplementary role, in accordance with the Labour Code. The agreement of 3 April 2020 does not therefore call into question the company agreements already signed, nor the company negotiations currently underway.\r\r*Short-time working*\rThe agreement invites companies to 'seek with the social partners, beyond the preservation of employment, a change in the conditions of compensation' for short-time working, 'to mitigate its negative impacts' (on the purchasing power of employees).\rThe agreement recalls that the period of short-time working can be used for training actions. It adds that when occupational health and safety conditions are \"irreproachable, guaranteed and applied\", the training action can be implemented \"in situ\", within the company, if necessary, in a work situation. In this context, the joint body in charge of vocational training (OPCO 2i) is invited to provide collective training actions for employees of VSEs and SMEs. \"The signatories thus wish to gradually prepare, under the best conditions, the return to normal activity\u00bb.\r\r*Exceptional management of paid leave*\rThe agreement opens up the possibility for the employer to set or change the date for taking six working days of paid leave per employee. This possibility will be open as soon as the agreement is tabled and will end on October 31, 2020. It may result in the taking of leave in advance of the period during which it is normally intended to be taken.\rThe employer must respect an order of priority. The employer chooses:\r- first, the taking of paid leave earned during the previous accrual period;\r- then, the taking of conventional days earned (seniority leave, in particular);\r- lastly, the taking of paid leave acquired during the last vesting period, which may lead to early taking.\rThe employer must respect a period of notice, set at two working days during the confinement period and five days thereafter.

This was a package of several measures which have been taken to combat the pandemic and its effects.\rThe Qredits microfinancing system is an existing government sponsored financier. This microcredits fund is more a permanent feature that is being temporally expanded as part of the package of emergency measures by the national government.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Qredits microcredit fund is a governmental fund which provides financing as well as support and coaching to micro and small enterprises which face challenges gaining financing via more traditional avenues (such as bank loans). \rUsers of the fund tend to be small, notably micro-enterprises and are often run by individuals with a poorer socio-economic or migrant background. \rWith the aim of supporting small entrepreneurs who are hit by the COVID-19-related measures, Qredits has relaxed some of the financing conditions. \rSmall entrepreneurs can delay their loan payments for up to 6 months and the interest rate will be kept at 2%. The national government supports Qredits in this effort with a maximum of \u20ac6 million. ",

This was a package of several measures which have been taken to contrast the outbreak and its effects, announced on March 17th, 2020.\rThis measure aims to help small farms and farmers to keep their businesses afloat. It targets enterprises in the horti- and agricultural sectors as a whole because this sector was one of the first to feel a marked hit from the crisis. This includes the provision of food and other grown products, not just for domestic consumption but also for trade. The seasonality of work in this sector and the timing of the COVID-19 crisis seem to have led to this group of enterprises receiving specific support.\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The sectors covered here by this measure include the agriculture and horticulture sector, the fisheries sector, and the aquaculture sector. These sectors are all confronted by an international and domestic decrease in demand for their produce.\r\rThe Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit - LNV), will therefore temporarily underwrite working capital granted to farms and horticultural companies under the the Guarantee for Agricultural SME Credit, (Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten), which is part of the Guarantee SME Loans scheme for small and medium-sized farms and enterprises.\rIn this way, the government will act as a guarantor for loans granted to farms. The government seeks to ensure that the scope of this scheme will be broadened in the short term. Enterprises can seek credit to bridge their troubled times of up to \u20ac15 million, for which the Ministry of LNV will act as guarantor for up to 70%. The credit will be for a maximum of 2 years. \rThis measure was set to stay into force for 3 months initially, but the timing for COVID-19-related measures is constantly evolving and this may change.",

This happens in a direct consultation fashion or through tripartite meetings (facilitated by the National Labour Foundation).

This applies to workers with permanent as well as flexible or temporary contracts.\rThe ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.\rThis measure is part of the package of emergency measures to deal with the corona virus.

The government subsidizes up to 90% of the wage costs of staff for a period of up to three months. This applies to workers on permanent contracts as well as flexible contracts (including zero hour \"nul uren\" contracts, or on call contracts \"oproep contracten\"). However, in return enterprises may not fire anyone (fixed and flexible employment contracts alike), for economic reasons during the period of time covered by the allowance.  \rIt should be noted that given the ever evolving situation, the government also considers extending this measure beyond the initially intended 3 months.",

In the Netherlands relevant, national sectoral social partners are often involved in national policy making in a consultational capacity so that partners may reflect on regulatory plans and their intended impacts.

It is also part of a package of emergency measures accepted by the Dutch parliament.\rThis has been introduced as a bunch of emergency measures specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. More specific, this measure is aimed at providing self-employed a minimum income to live from. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) until the pandemic is under control.\r\rThe municipal governments implement this national measure. The proceeding has been conducted employing the existing implementation mechanisms for another measure, the Bbz regulation (a separate, existing measure which helps struggling entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs who wish to end their enterprise, or individuals who wish to start an enterprise from a welfare position).\r\rThe funding is provided entirely by the national government. The municipal governments are fully reimbursed by a portion of budget set aside by the national Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs, to the amount of 3.8 billion euro. This amount has been reserved for the Tozo measure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure, named Tijdelijke Overbruggingsregeling Zelfstandige Ondernemers (TOZO) is governmental financial aid for self-employed people and entrepreneurs that are negatively affected by the COVID-19. \rThe government and municipal governments pay a portion of the income for entrepreneurs and self-employed to supplement their daily subsistence. Users of the measure can receive either a payment in the form of a social security benefit, where the municipal government pays out money to bring an entrepreneur to the minimum social assistance level (bijstandsniveau) for up to three months. \rThe municipal governments supplement income up to this level, or up to the amount of \u20ac1,050 for a single person and up to \u20ac1,500 for a couple. The other option is for the entrepreneur to take out a loan of up to around \u20ac10,000 as capital for the enterprise. This loan can be paid back within three years at an interest rate of 2%. \rThe eligibility criteria are based on being self-employed (working at least 1,225 hours a year or 23.5 hours a week), while the solo-enterprise must have been active before the COVID-19 crisis and the TOZO came into effect.\rIt should be noted that this measure is separate and different from the Bbz measure (mentioned in the background information to this measure). Where the Bbz is a measure to help support existing entrepreneurs or individuals receiving welfare payments to set-up an enterprise, the TOZO is an emergency measure to help provide rapid financial support to enterprises. The TOZO measure is registered as a type of welfare payment within the Bbz for administrative ease and efficiency (this way a new system of screening and delivery did not need to be set up). The access to TOZO financing is easier than with the Bbz, certain criteria were removed, including the check of partner earnings for instance. The application for TOZO financing is also made quicker, taking up to 4 weeks instead of the usual 13 weeks\r\r",

Before the change, EGO158/2005 granted paid medical and quarantine leave  only for the employees that had their contribution paid for minimum 6 months. The paid quarantine leave amounts for 75% of the basic salary.\r\rAdditionally, the period during which people in quarantine may request payment of medical leave has doubled from 90 to 180 days. These regulations are valid during the period of emergency established by Decree 195/2020 (so far 15 March \u2013 15 May 2020) and are intended to prevent illnesses.\r",

However, the cultural and creative sector, especially badly hit, expressed concern that more was needed for its support. Museums, cultural institutes, events, performances and performers voiced concerns that the crisis could mean that many would have to close their doors for good. Beyond the fact that many people simply cannot attend events, performances, of cultural institutes and this meaning a loss of income, there is also a seasonality to the sector (with many events taking place in the spring and summer). These developments have led to extra measures being taken. On March 27th, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The package of measures announced contain a series of specific measures for different groups within the sector.\rMuseums subsidized by the government may delay the payments of their rents by three months to give them some financial breathing room.\rEasing of the heritage laws: heritage institutes are being given more time to prepare their annual reports and annual financial accounts. Instead of submitting their accounts on April 1st, they may now do so by June 1st 2020 instead.\rSubsidies to cultural institutes will be paid out by the government and there is an easing of the rule that subsidies are reduced if planned performance targets are not met by the institutes. This also applies to subsidies to specific projects and initiatives; subsidies will still be paid even if certain planned targets are not met.\rThe six main national cultural funds will also help to implement the measures above and so doing, help the cultural institutes those respective funds support.\r\rThe measure applies to enterprises as well as institutes.

A criterion is that enterprises and private organisations should have made use of other governmental support such as the Tozo.\r\rThis extra budget is aimed to help institutes and organisations.

The loan application will be submitted directly to the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will also grant the funds for up to five years with the possibility of using the grace period of up to one year. This COVID-19 measure for SMEs in the tourism industry is implemented as a temporary measure under the Working Capital Lending Program and applies to requests received at HBOR by 31 December 2020 or until the use of secured funds. There is no right to credit, but HBOR makes a separate decision on each claim.\r\rThe interest rate, thanks to subsidy funds, can be zero percent for the repayment period of up to three years, and in the fourth and fifth repayment years the interest rate can be 1.5 percent (the interest rate depends on state aid regulations). The minimum loan amount that can be applied for is EUR 100 thousand and the highest is limited to EUR 1.25 million in HRK equivalent. The funds can be used to finance salaries, overheads and other basic operating expenses, preparation of the tourist season, and settlement of liabilities to suppliers and other expenses, except for credit obligations to commercial banks, other financial institutions or VAT liabilities.",

As part of these measures, the Revenue service operates a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The scheme enables employees whose employers are affected by the pandemic to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system. The scheme is expected to last 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.\r\rThe scheme was introduced as part of the terms of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.\r\rOn Wednesday 15 April, the Minister for Finance announced further updates to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Scheme is available to employers from all sectors (excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector) whose business activities are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\rIt is open to employers who retain staff on payroll; some of the staff may be temporarily not working or some may be on reduced hours and/or reduced pay. Provided the employer meets certain conditions and, subject to the levels of pay made to employees, the employer may be eligible for the scheme for some, or all of its employees.\r\rThe employer includes the subsidy as part of the employees\u2019 wages in addition to any amount that the employer would otherwise be able to pay. The subsidy element on the employee\u2019s payslip is indicated as a payment described as \u201cGovCov19 WageSub\u201d.  \r\rA subsidy of 85% is payable for employees whose net weekly income does not exceed \u20ac412. \rA subsidy of 70% is payable for those whose net weekly pay was previously no more than \u20ac500 but less than \u20ac586, with a cap of \u20ac410.\r\rTo qualify for the Scheme, employers must be experiencing significant negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Revenue, a minimum of a 25% decline in turnover and be unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully. They must also retain their employees on the payroll.\r\rThe scheme is confined to employees who were on the employer\u2019s payroll as at 29 February 2020, and for whom a payroll submission was made to Revenue in the period from 1 February 2020 to 15 March 2020.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "47,400 employers are registered with Revenue for the scheme.\r\rAccording to the minister responsible, on 29 April 2020, 'The cumulative value of payments made to employers under the scheme is \u20ac652 million, almost 400,000 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme'. ",
            "descriptionViewsOfSocialPartners": "Ibec, the group that represents Irish business, welcomed the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). Ibec CEO Danny McCoy said: \u201cThe TWSS scheme offers a strong solution for business and workforce continuity. It will continue to play a vital role in enabling the economy to bounce back at the other end of this crisis, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals.\r\rPatricia King, General-Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcomed the Government\u2019s decision to establish a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to maintain jobs and support workers\u2019 incomes during this unprecedented crisis, as first called for by ICTU in it's letter of 18 March to the Taoiseach when we  outlined the urgent need for a 'temporary wage subsidy scheme\u2019 that would help to keep workers in their jobs, protect them from unemployment and loss of income, and to help the economy rapidly recover when the Covid ends. \"These unprecedented times demand unprecedented measures to minimise the impact on workers, their families and the business community\",Patricia King said.",

The lending decisions are made by the banks and not subject to government intervention. \r\rThe Scheme is targeted towards companies who are unable to access credit because of \rinadequate collateral, difficulty of accessing credit due to novel business market or technology or requirements to refinance given exit of SME lenders from the Irish market.\r\rLoan facilities can be from \u20ac10,000 up to \u20ac1m for terms of up to 7 years with the possibility of \ra three to six-month interest-only payment period (depending on the total loan duration). Borrowing SMEs pay an interest rate premium of 0.5% per annum (initially in 2019/20; rate may vary thereafter) to partially cover the state costs of the guarantee.\r\r\r\r\r\r",

It is important to take flexible paths - from management to production and working methods to sales and communication internally and externally. The goal of this initivie is to maintain operations, secure jobs - and at the same time protect the health of customers and employees. For this reason, the regional government of Styria (Land Steiermark, with its support service provider SFG) and  the Chamber of Labour in the region of Styria (AK Steiermark) have started their  promotion campaign 'Teleworking! Offensive' retrospectively from 1 March 2020.",

These are investments in information and communication technology for workplaces outside the company location. This includes some hardware and software, the initial start-up and licenses. \r\rFor the incurred expenses, a 50% from the regional state, and another 30% come from AK Steiermark can be received as non repayable grants. Alternatively, the rent or lease of equipment is supported by covering down payments or costs for a maximum of five months. \r\rCosts for the ongoing operation of internet access, telephone, electricity etc., but also office and business equipment, such as furniture etc are not covered. \r\rThe maximum eligible costs are \u20ac50,000 per company and \u20ac5,000 per teleworker (average view). The grant volume must be between \u20ac1,000 and \u20ac40,000.\rIn total funds for supporting 2,300 teleworking jobs have been set up. \r\rEligible are employers in Styria who are classified as SMEs. Excluded are one-person microenterprises, tourism and leisure businesses, nonprofit organisations, healthcare companies and people outside the SFG target group.",

In recent weeks, there has been considerable financial market volatility. The outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19) and the measures to limit contagion will have a significant negative impact on growth in the Norwegian economy. There is substantial uncertainty about the duration and the consequences of the outbreak, with a risk of a pronounced economic downturn. Norwegian banks are solid. They have sufficient capital to absorb losses in the event of a severe downturn. A tightening of lending standards may, however, amplify the downturn in the economy.

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure applies to all health care professionals and students who have come far enough in their studies to be able to work in the sector. All healthcare professionals between the age of 18-67 who live in Finland are within the scope of this measure.  \r\rHowever, individual helth care professionals experience, current job status and other circumstances also weigh in. Health care professionals who are caregivers to a child or other person cannot be obliged to work. \r\rPublic employment and business services (TE-services) are resposible for organising this measure and they create a database of eligible health care professionals. They will consult employers regarding their need for extra labour force. \r\rDuration of work obligation is maximum two weeks long and it can be renewed once. Salaries are paid in accordance with collective agreements. \r\rIt is also important to point out that obliging health care professionals to work is treated as last resort and it shall be used only when other options such as regular recruitment are not enough to secure functioning of the health care system. \r\r",

While rules on the daily maximum working time, duration of extended service hours, maximum number of extended service hours, and maximum weekly working hours in individual weeks will not apply in these cases, the average weekly working time can only be increased with written approval by the employee.\r\rIn a decree from 16 April 2020, and applicable as of 11 April, it was also clarified that rules on driving and rest periods stemming from (EC) No 561/2006 will be adjusted. Daily driving time has been increased to 11 hours, weekly driving time to 60 hours, and the sum of driving time in two consecutive weeks to 100 hours.

Mainly due to an undersupply of dwellings, house prices and rents are comparatively among the highest in Europe. Rents or mortgage payments are the largest proportion of income people in Ireland spend. The job or income losses due to the pandemic situation has aggravated this crisis, increasing the difficulty many people face with keeping up with mortgage and rent payments. At the same time, the possibility to find new accomodation is reduced in times of the public health policy with social distancing. As part of its package of 'Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020' the Irish government therefore introduced a restrictions on evictions and rent freezes for landlords.",

Renters may not be evicted from their home, or \r2. be served a notice of termination by their landlord.Notices of termination which the renter had received prior to the emergency period are frozen for the duration of the Emergency (3 months).\r3. It is also prohibited for landlords to increase rents.\r\rAll types of rentals are included, such as shared accommodation with the landlord, student accommodation and \u2018digs\u2019 type accommodation where meals are provided.\r\rRenters shall continue to pay rent and continue to follow any rules as part of their tenancy.\r\rRenters having difficulties to pay their rents should contact their landlords and possibly on a reduced amount for the duration of the situation.

On 10 April, the HSE announced that there will be an increase in the annual intake of medical interns this year, from 734 to approximately 1,100. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and the Irish Medical Council also took steps to make it easier for nurses and doctors to return to the register (e.g. by waiving registration fees). \r\rThe COVID-19 Act provides for health and social care professionals who want to return to work to have their applications to be registered with their regulatory bodies accelerated and returned to the register without paying a fee until 30 July 2020 (with possibility extend this date). \r\rMedical and nursing schools have also been fast-tracking students to qualification to deal with the pandemic.\r\rThe Act also offers some protection to healthcare professionals, other than doctors, who may practise medicine during the pandemic (normally prohibited). They can do so under the direction and control of a registered medical practitioner, or in accordance with directions in writing given by a registered medical practitioner.\r\rWith regard to other public servants and teachers, the Department of Education issues a circular to school managers on 27 March 27 indicated that all public servants 'must be available to carry out work either to deliver services within their own sector or for temporary assignment within the wider public service...'.

Workers and technicians in short-time working will thus be paid 92% of their net salary, instead of the 84% provided for by the legal system. This is made possible by the solidarity of managers on partial unemployment, whose net pay will increase from 100% to 92%.",

The agreement brings the remuneration of all employees to 92% of their usual net remuneration. According to the President of Renault Trucks France, \"this agreement makes it possible to treat all employees fairly during this unprecedented period of crisis. It offers each employee who wishes to do so, the opportunity to approach 100% of his or her remuneration through the use of days off, while safeguarding the future of the company. In addition to the solidarity contribution of the employees, the company's contribution amounts to 8% of the payroll\". In detail, on a voluntary basis, it is possible for all employees on short-time work to give 1.6 day for every 20 days they are unemployed to the company in order to keep their full pay.\rThis agreement also secures the maintenance of individual salary increases with effect from 1 April 2020 and the payment of the profit-sharing bonus (prime d'int\u00e9ressement) in June. The company will limit mandatory leave during the period of partial employment to a maximum of 5 days in 2020.",

Three axes are planned to achieve this objective: the creation of a \"social solidarity\" mechanism to supplement the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity situations; the possibility of adapting the programming of holidays in each establishment; the implementation of a reinforced protocol of barrier gestures. The agreement is applicable until October 31, 2020. The provisions concerning the creation of a solidarity fund will cease on 30 April 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The main content of the measure consist of:\r\r1. Solidarity Fund\"Since March 16, 2020, all the activities of the group's industrial and commercial system have been stopped, which has led the company to place the vast majority of staff under the partial activity regime\", according to the agreement, which emphasizes that managers or technicians on fixed-days contracts already benefit from contractual provisions allowing them to maintain their remuneration in the event of partial unemployment. In order to enable all professional categories (employees, workers and technicians, managers on lump-sum hours) to benefit from guaranteed remuneration for the period from 16 March to 30 April, the agreement sets up a solidarity fund. The fund will be financed by the payment of two days' leave for managers and one day for workers and technicians. Employees will be able to voluntarily pay the remainder of their paid leave that could not be used before May 31, 2020. \rFor its part, PSA Automobiles undertakes to top up the days paid into the fund by 40%. These payments should make it possible to maintain employees' remuneration for a full month for 100% of the workforce. In the event that the partial activity is extended to all or part of the company's establishments, priority will be given to voluntary payments. If necessary, an additional number of days may be deducted. This may be done by half-day (excluding paid holidays) \"to adjust as best as possible to the gradual takeover of the sites\", up to a limit of 0.5 days for workers and technicians and one day for managers.\r\r2. Arrangement of paid holidays\rThe agreement takes into account Order No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020 allowing for the adaptation of the terms and conditions for taking paid holidays. Thus, each head of establishment will be able to impose the taking of six working days of leave during the period of partial activity, from 7 April to 31 October 2020. This week of paid leave may be taken either consecutively if the site's activity has been completely suspended, or non-consecutively if the site's activity is partially maintained.\rWith regard to the setting of the weeks of paid summer holidays, each head of establishment will also be able to adjust their positioning, provided that each employee is guaranteed at least 12 consecutive working days over the period between 1 July and 31 August. In this context, the agreement provides for priority in the choice of dates for employees whose spouses cannot change their departure dates, for single-parent families, and for employees working 100% during the period of partial activity in their establishment. The latter will also be able to keep the previously set dates, or take three consecutive weeks of leave. In addition, their unused leave balance as of May 31, 2020 may exceptionally be carried forward until December 31, 2020. Finally, the agreement specifies that all employees who have not been able to take their remaining paid leave before May 31, 2020, due to the resumption of activity or the needs of the establishments, will be able to take these days until July 31, 2020.\r\r3. An enhanced security protocol\rThe agreement recalls that, since the start of the health crisis at Covid-19, PSA Automobiles has adopted a reinforced health protocol of barrier gestures (wearing of masks on site, respect of distances with floor markings, ventilation of work spaces, longer break times for hand washing, etc.). Currently being rolled out at all industrial, commercial, service and engineering sites, these measures are subject to internal audits and assessment by health and safety committees to ensure their \"perfect\" implementation.

The Act (abbreviated as the \u201cSpecial Act\u201d) is a follow-up to the initial ad-hoc regulation introduced in early March. \r\rUstawa z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczeg\u00f3lnych rozwi\u0105zaniach zwi\u0105zanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdzia\u0142aniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chor\u00f3b zaka\u017anych oraz wywo\u0142anych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Clause 15 of the Special Act opens a possibility to introduce working time arrangements less favourable for employees than the those stipulated by the Labour Code. In particular, employers may reduce the uninterrupted rest periods, both daily and weekly. In normal circumstances, they must amount to 11 and 35 hours, respectively. In current circumstances, they can be cut down to 8 and 32 hours respectively. Yet, the shortened hours of rest must be returned to employees within eight weeks at the longest. Another possibility given by the Special Act is to introduce an equivalent working time system with number of daily working hours increased to 12. Longer hours on certain days must be compensated be shorter hours on other days, so the total working time is balanced within the period of 12 months. \r\rIn addition, the employer may introduce less favourable working conditions than those stipulated by the Labour Code.  \rIn order to legally use those options, employers have to meet the following conditions:\r\r1. experience decrease in sales by at least 15% experienced over two consecutive months after 1 January 2020 (the reference period comprised the same two months of the previous year) due to COVID-19 outbreak;\r2. experience decrease in sales by at least 25% experienced on a month-to-month basis after 1 January 2020 (no specific reason required);\r3. have had all public dues and social security contributions duly paid.\r\rIn all aforementioned cases the employer must obtain consent of the onsite employee representation, either company-level trade unions or in the absence of such, with employee represenatives elected in a 'way usual for the employer', in line with the Clause 23/1a of the Labour Code.\r",

This is called the degressivity of unemployment benefits. The measure suspends this degressive element of unemployment benefits for all unemployed in Belgium.\r\rMore specifically, the phase or sub-phase of the compensation period in which the person concerned finds himself on 1 April 2020 will be extended by three months.\r\rThis also applies to persons applying for benefits during the months April to June 2020. The phase in which the unemployed person starts will be extended by the period of that phase during the months of April to June 2020.",

For March alone it is estimated that approximately 900,000 people will have made use of the temporary unemployment scheme. In addition to that there are also the people that were unemployed before the crisis.",

As part of the gradual relaunch of public activity, gastronomic establishments may reopen from 15 May onwards, but with special obligations, such as keeping minimum distances between tables, maximum numbers of guests per table, waiters wearing masks among others. It is believed that the 'return to normal' will not be easy under such conditions, not-least as consumers are advised not to go out too often and many have faced a loss of income. Lower revenues are therefore expected in the months to come. \r\r",

It is considered as a complementary measure to the Federal support package for the gastronomic services, and aimed to stimulate consumer demand and the appetite to go out again. \r\rThe campaign 'Vienna Gastro Voucher' will start in June, and it is envisaged to run until September 2020. All 950,000 Viennese households are going to receive a voucher by post. One-person households receive a \u20ac25 voucher, households with more people receive a voucher worth \u20ac50. The vouchers can be redeemed in Viennese restaurants, pubs and cafes participating in the scheme. Alcohol can not be purchased with the vouchers.\r\rAccording to the city of Vienna, the campaign is expected to amount to \u20ac40 million euros. ",

The reference is the arr\u00eat\u00e9 royal n\u00b0 23 du 13.05.2020 taken under article 5, \u00a71, 5\u00b0, of the law of  27 Mars 2020 with respect to the special measures to be taken to fight the coronavirus COVID-19 (II).

To benefit from the 20% reduction the parent should work full-time and to benefit from the 50% reduction the parent should work at least 75% of a full-time.  If an employed parent wishes to reduce their work by 100% or 10% they should apply for the traditional parental leave,  self-employed parents however can apply for a 100 percent reduction of work via the Corona parental leave.\r\rParents that have worked for 1 month in the private sector or 1 day in the public sector are eligible for the Corona parental leave. Parents that are self-employed as main activity are also eligible, but not if they are benefiting from the Bridge benefit (see elsewhere in the database).\r\rThe flat-rate benefit is 25% higher than the benefit for the traditional parental leave, for example \u20ac149,60 for a 20% reduction  as compared to \u20ac119,68 for the traditional parental leave for employed parents.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Workers in slaughterhouses in Germany, which often employ migrant workers and workers from temporary work agencies, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infections. Many factories had to close for several weeks. Working conditions in industrial meat factories have been subject of political debate before, but shortcomings in occupational health and safety, infection prevention and health protection standards, and the resulting high number of infections, now have led to the implementation of new regulations in the meat industry. This followed a debate in the German parliament and a meeting of the responsible minister with industry representatives. New regulations are to be be put in law and the competent authorities will enforce them more vigorously. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The German government lists the following measures (see source dated 20 May 2020):\r\r* Customs and occupational safety authorities as well as district regulatory authorities and health offices are to take additional steps to ensure compliance with occupational health and safety, infection prevention and health protection standards;\r* As of 1 January 2021 butchering and processing of meat may only be performed by employees of the company itself. Contract workers and the leasing of temporary workers will no longer be permitted. Artisanal businesses will be exempted from this regulation;\r* The level of fines imposed for contravention of the Working Time Act is to be doubled to \u20ac30,000;\r* The government will also examine ways of obliging companies to ensure compliance with minimum standards in workers' accommodation;\r* The financial and legal basis of the 'Fair Mobility' project is to be ensured on a permanent basis so that foreign workers are informed in their own language about their rights and about pertinent regulations in Germany",

The German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) and Nahrung-Genuss-Gastst\u00e4tten (NGG), a trade union in the food industry, welcomed the regulations as a basis to put an end to organising the entire production process through chains of subcontractors. \r\rOn the side of employer organisations, the measures were critizised. The Central Association of the German Poultry Industry described the decision 'wrong and disproportionate' and as a risk to keeping factories open and preserving jobs.",
